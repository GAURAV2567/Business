Both body and rotor are still made of\u00a0Daiwa\u2019s\u00a0exclusive carbon composite,\u00a0ZAION V, but completely redesigned to offer even more lightness, smoothness and strength.\nThe rotor is now of the\u00a0AIRDRIVE\u00a0type: thanks to a reduction in the weight of the rotating masses and a spherically inspired aerodynamic design, the new Exceler allows for superior feel and sensitivity during retrieval due to reduced inertia.\nThe new\u00a0AIRDRIVE solid\u00a0bow has a conformation designed to prevent tangles even when the line has low tension.

            "description": "Daiwa BG MQ 8000 -14000H Spinning Reels\nDescription:\nDaiwa\u2019s BG series has changed the game of what affordable quality looks like in heavy-duty spinning reels. Now, by combining Monocoque Body (MQ) technology with the mass market appeal of BG, 20 BG MQ is born.\nMonocoque Body (MQ) is the single biggest revolution in spinning reel design from Daiwa by totally eliminating the traditional two-piece body construction. MQ reels don\u2019t use any side plates and feature a\u00a0completely screwless body design which eliminates potential entry points for water &amp; grime, and significantly enhances overall body strength and rigidity.\u00a0\nThe screwless design principle of MQ bodies are also significantly more compact than a standard body design. Screws need material to grip to, and that means more overall size and more mass in traditional body designs. By replacing the side plate with a machined aluminium engine plate which screws directly into the reel body, MQ reels can maximise the internal space made available by using larger size drive gears than before.\nThroughout the entire line-up of BG MQ, vast improvements have been made to almost all areas of the reel design. The drag has been improved both in maximum capacity but also in smooth overall performance, drastically reducing the friction of the Carbon ATD drag - BG MQ\u2019s drag performance is unmatched by the competition.\nThe MQ body construction not only has\u00a0the obvious benefits of a stronger &amp; more compact body design, it also delivers an increase in gear durability thanks to absolute zero movement of drivetrain components once installed inside an MQ body. Weather-sealing is also significantly improved, with seals visible in multiple locations throughout the reel, BG MQ is built for the harshest of environments.\nCasting performance has also been improved with the implementation of Long Cast ABS (LC-ABS) spool design. LC-ABS spool design improves line flow from the spool, resulting in increased casting distances across the board with both heavy &amp; light lines.\nThroughout the BG MQ range, improvements have been made specific to the size of each reel to maximise their performance and overall appeal to each target market.\nSmall size BG MQ (2500-4000) feature dramatically larger sized drive gears. Middle sized models 5000 &amp; 6000 now feature the Rigid Air Rotor design, maximising strength and appeal for mid-weight sportfishing applications. Larger size BG MQ from 8000-20000 receive huge benefits as a result of the MQ body, with the leg &amp; main body drastically increased in strength without increasing weight.\nBG MQ marks a new era in affordable saltwater spinning reels from Daiwa, with MQ technology now available to the masses. BG MQ is built for the harshest conditions and is set to once again revolutionise the industry. Available from 2500-20000 size, BG MQ is now aligned with 20 SALTIGA sizing.\nFeatures:\n\n\nABS LONGCAST\nCompared to conventional spools, the LC-ABS has been shown to increase the average flight distance by approx. 5% due to its reduced weight and modified shape.\n\n\nATD DRAG\nDaiwa's Automatic Tournament Drag uses an improved drag grease that exhibits a low viscosity at rest, yet becomes more viscous immediately after drag start up. This reduces initial drag start-up inertia and combined with the structural changes of the ATD Drag System results in a smoother drag from the initial hook up.\n\n\nMETAL ALLOY BODY\nRock solid in strength and performance, alloy is tailor made for Australian conditions and allows a reel to be created that is light, yet strong, and supremely rigid and highly corrosion resistant.\n\n\nMONOCOQUE (MQ)\nA one-piece frame eliminates the use of traditional two-piece body &amp; sideplate construction. A single piece body utilises a screw-in engine plate to house the main gear, reducing flex and twist under load creating a sealed mechanism. The elimination of the side plate also has also allowed for a more compact body design. MQ technology not only makes reels stronger &amp; better sealed, but also more compact.\n\n\nSpecifications:\n\n\n\nModel No\n20 BG MQ 8000-H\n20 BG MQ 10000-H\n20 BG MQ 14000-H\n\n\nGear Ratio\n5.7:1\n5.7:1\n5.7:1\n\n\nWeight (g/oz)\n635g\n646g\n640g\n\n\nMax Drag (kg/lb)\n15kg\n15kg\n15kg\n\n\nBall Bearings\n6BB; 1RB\n6BB; 1RB\n6BB; 1RB\n\n\n\nSpool Capacity\n\nPE 4/300m\nPE 5/300m\nPE 6/300m\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0",

            "description": "\nIt is introducing the new Saltist MQ reel, equipped with a single-piece aluminum Monocoque body designed to withstand the tough conditions of Australian saltwater fishing and the hardy fish in these waters. One of Daiwa's most renowned features, Magseal, combines with the MQ body to create a reel that is well-protected from the harsh marine environment. The larger diameter Tough Digigear, housed in the single piece Monocoque body, transfers power delivered through the handle to your line, enabling you to stop even the strongest fish in their tracks.\u00a0\nIn addition, Saltist MQ features a tubular hollow Air Bail, which enhances line management and improves line flow back into the line roller, providing unmatched performance even in windy conditions with the lightest braids. With a comprehensive size range from 2500 up to 20000, there is a Saltist MQ reel suitable for every fishing location in the country. Whether you're casting lures or dropping baits for reef species and pelagics, or fishing in coastal estuaries and rivers, Saltist MQ has got you covered.\u00a0\nAll Saltist MQ models now come with the Aluminium Round Knob, providing superior grip and stability. If you're in the market for a new saltwater spinning reel that can handle the toughest conditions, look no further than the brand-new Saltist MQ.\nProduct Features:\u00a0\nMonocoque (MQ) \u2013 One Piece Body\nMQ Body takes reel design to the next level. The MQ system does not require conventional side plate, instead using an engine plate to screw directly to the body. Eliminating the need for screws to hold a body cover in place. MQ body improves the strength of the reel, it also improves the water resistance of the body and allows a larger diameter drive gear to be installed.\nABS-Longcast \u2013 Long Cast Spool Technology\nCompared to conventional spools, the LC-ABS has been shown to increase the average flight distance by approx. 5% due to its reduced weight and modified shape.\nAir-Bail\nDaiwa\u2019s innovative bail design features a hollow tubular stainless steel bail that delivers maximum rigidity and strength with minimum weight. Featuring a smooth protrusion-free design and construction line easily slides unencumbered along the Air Bail towards the line roller for trouble-free line control.\nAir-Rotor \u2013 Lightweight Rotor\nLighter, stronger, and more balanced than any rotor system that\u2019s come before, \u2018Air Rotor\u2019 delivers a great leap forward in rotor design and function and delivers the ultimate line roller support. Made from Zaion and featuring a redesigned arch that disperses pressure to the lower section of the rotor to reduce stressing and flexing, the design is further enhanced with a hollowed-out construction reducing weight, while increasing reel sensitivity and rotational balance.\nATD-Drag \u2013 Automatic Tournament Drag\nDaiwa\u2019s Automatic Tournament Drag uses an improved drag grease that exhibits a low viscosity at rest, yet becomes more viscous immediately after drag start-up. This reduces initial drag start-up inertia and combined with the structural changes of the ATD Drag System results in a smoother drag from the initial hook-up.\nMachine Cut Handle\nOur new handle design is slimmer, more compact, and 50% lighter.\u00a0\nInfinite Anti Reverse\nDaiwa's advanced system that limits rearward back play handle movement to almost zero for solid hooksets with less shock to the reel. The result is the elimination of handle slap-back and the unwanted release of line.\nMagsealed-Body\nUltimate protection is delivered to the engine room of the reel with a magnetised oil seal located on the main shaft of the reel\u2019s rotor shutting the door to the elements and unwanted intruders. Dust, water, and salt intrusion into the inner workings of a reel are a thing of the past with MagSeal.\nMetal Ball Knob\nProviding maximum contact between the handle knob and the hand, ball knobs are designed for optimal rotation balance, rotation, and functionality.\nMetal Alloy Body\nRock solid in strength and performance, the alloy is tailor made for Australian conditions and allows a reel to be created that is light, yet strong, supremely rigid and highly corrosion resistant.\nPerfect Line Stopper \u2013 Improved Line Clip Design\nOur new larger rectangular flexible clip can be used from all line angles and from light to heavy lines.\n\nSpecification\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nModel.

If you are a competition angler, or fish using a float or feeder, and want a reel to match your ability, the Aero XR is the solution. All of the reels balance perfectly with Shimano\u2019s best Aero X5, X7 and Pro match and feeder rods, giving you an enviable combination that offer a competitive advantage. With their super smooth waterproof drags, and an additional anti-reverse facility, you can play fish directly off the drag when using stronger lines, by back-winding when using fine lines, or by using a combination of both.\u00a0\n\u00a0The larger 5000 model has an additional reducer for use with braid when feeder fishing at long range. Power is delivered by a very direct screw in handle and a metal line clip, that is strong and line-safe, reinforces the XR\u2019s feeder fishing pedigree.Visually, the understated \u2018stealth-like\u2019 looks of the Aero XR are stunning and combined with the advanced engineering technology can\u2019t fail to inspire your confidence to perform at the highest level.\n\n\nHAGANE GEAR\n\nWith amazing strength and durability, the HAGANE Gear is at the very heart of most Shimano reels. Shimano, through the application of state-of-the-art technologies, gives anglers the long-lasting smoothness and enjoyment that is felt when anglers first use a reel, over and over again. No cutting work is applied to the teeth of the drive gear during fabrication; instead, the entire surface is calculated in minute detail by a special 3D design and then formed by Shimano's cold-forging technology. The result is assured resilience. HAGANE Gear is the result of Shimano's endless pursuit for durability \u2014 this strength and power of forged metal continue to represent the fundamental concept of Shimano reels.\n\n\n\n\n\nX SHIP\n\nX SHIP provides improved gear performance. Large diameter drive gear, optimally positioned pinion gear and drive gear, and two points bearings supported pinion gear produce light reeling under load.\nNote: Comes with spare spool\n\n\nSpecifications:\n\n\n\n\nModel No\nC5000\n\n\nGear Ratio\u00a0\n4.5:1\n\n\nMax Drag\u00a0\n11kg\n\n\nWeight\u00a0\n250g\n\n\nSpool Dia.\n54/17mm\n\n\nNylon Mono(mm-m)\n0.35-175\n\n\nLine Retrieve/Crank\n80cm\n\n\nBearings\n5+1\n\n\n",

            "description": "Okuma Helios SX spinning reels are constructed of C-40X carbon and the TORSION CONTROL ARMOR\u00ae design make the reel extremely rigid and lighter, also reduce twist and torque and keep the internal parts in perfect alignment for freshwater and inshore saltwater fishing.\nFeatures\n\nLight weight C-40X carbon frame and side plates\nC-40X Cyclonic Flow Rotor for corrosion resistance\nTCA\u2122: TORSION CONTROL ARMOR\u00ae reduces twisting\n8HPB + 1RB corrosion resistant stainless steel bearings\nQuick-Set anti-reverse roller bearing\nPrecision machine cut brass pinion gear\nALG: Precision Aluminites alloy main gear and oscillating gears\nRigid, machined aluminum, anodized handle\nLight weight, EVA handle knobs for comfort\nPrecision Elliptical Gearing system\nMachined aluminum, 2-tone anodized spool\nHeavy duty, solid aluminum bail wire\nRESII: Computer balanced Rotor Equalizing System\nLCS line control spool\n\n\n\n\nCentrifugal Disc Bail (CDB)\nThe Centrifugal Disc Bail (CDB) design incorporates a heavier brass disc that is perfectly weighted and balanced to create smoother bail operations. CDB increases the strength and stability of bail functions.\n\n\n\n\nProgressive Drag\nOkuma\u2019s 1-K woven carbon fiber drag knob is light weight and creates progressive drag settings. Our progressive drag allows you to customize settings to specific conditions and fish or adjust your drag during a long fight.\n\n\n\n\nC-40X\nOkuma\u2019s C-40X long strand carbon fiber technology utilizes a special blended graphite polymer. The carbon fibers in this material are elongated and reinforced, which creates a substantially stronger composite than standard graphite. At 25% lighter, 50% stronger and 100% anti-corrosive, C-40X translates into an extremely lightweight and durably constructed.\n\n\n\n\nCyclonic Flow Rotor (CFR)\nCyclonic Flow Rotor (CFR) was designed to create \u201ccyclonic\u201d airflow, which significantly increases air around the rotor, beneath and around the spool, with every turn of the handle. This thoroughly tested design allows for a much faster drying time if the reel becomes wet, minimizing corrosion and extending longevity of the reel.\n\n\n\n\nTORSION CONTROL ARMOR\u00ae (TCA\u2122)\nThe one-piece TCA\u2122 design was built using Okuma C-40X carbon fiber technology and made with a double arm design. Compared to traditional single side designs, TCA\u2122\u2019s double arm offers higher torsion and flex resistance under heavy pressure for improved strength. This not only makes the reel lighter but also extremely rigid ensuring the internal parts stays in perfect alignment.\n\n\n\nSpecifications:\n\n\n\nModel No.\n\nGear Ratio\n\nBearings\nMax Drag\nWeight\n\nLine retrieve (cm)\nLine Capacity\n\n\n\nHSX-40\n\n5.0:1\n\n8HPB + 1RB\n6kg\n\n262g\n\n76.2cm\n0.25/260, 0.30/180, 0.35/130\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "The CATANA FE is the latest version of a Shimano classic. Offering exceptional value for money, the CATANA is a freshwater and inshore saltwater spinning reel that can be used for all kinds of freshwater fishing.\nIf you are looking for a freshwater spinning reel at a very affordable price, the CATANA FE is one option you should not ignore. \nIdeal for a wide range of fishing, from lightweight and medium-sized lures, to match and feeder fishing, the understated appearance looks fantastic and the performance is remarkable for a reel of this price. Pair the CATANA with any low and mid-priced Shimano rod and you have a great combination that you will be proud to own and use. In use, you\u2019ll immediately notice the improved balance produced by Shimano\u2019s latest G-Free body design. \nThis body design is to be found on the very best Shimano reels and makes fishing easier over a long period of time. The smoothness you\u2019ll feel comes from a combination of 3 Shimano Stainless Steel Ball Bearings plus a Roller Bearing, which ensures trouble-free performance, even when playing the largest fish. Like top-of-the-range Shimano reels, the aluminum spool has an AR-C design, which combined with Varispeed II line lay improves casting distance and accuracy, with both mono and braided lines. \nPerhaps the most difficult decision you\u2019ll have to make is which CATANA size to choose. There are 7 models, including fast speed \u2018HG\u2019 versions, ranging from the smallest 1000 size suitable for lightweight \u2018finesse\u2019 fishing up to the largest 4000 size which is perfect for larger lures and heavy feeder fishing. Whichever you choose, the CATANA is guaranteed to give you many hours of fishing fun and excitement.\n\n\n\n Specification \n\n\n\n\nModel\nCAT 4000\u00a0\n\n\nNylon spool capacity(m/mm)\n180/0.30\n\n\nBearings\n3+1\n\n\nMax Drag\n8.5kg\n\n\nGear Ratio\n5.2:1\n\n\nWeight\n320g/11.3oz\n\n\n",

            "description": "\nShimano Hyperloop Spinning Reel\n\nThe Hyperloop features classical styling along with high-tech features such as Super Stopper and Varispeed line lay. By turning the handle you can immediately appreciate the quality of the gears, and vibration is almost eliminated by Shimano\u2019s Dyna Balance system. The Hyperloop also incorporates a Power Roller that keeps line twist to a minimum. Whereas the smaller models in this series are designed for all types of fishing such as spinning, float, feeder, or any other light to medium-heavy styles, the large 6000 size is an ideal model for heavy-duty spinning, bottom fishing or light surf casting.\n\nThe Shimano Hyperloop is a great value reel that will provide long service with minimal issues. Some of the features found on the Shimano Hyperloop 2500 fishing reel are the same features that are found on more expensive Shimano fishing reels.\nHaving Dyna-Balance, the Hyperloop doesn\u2019t wobble around when winding, and the Aerowave feature ensures that the line lays properly and doesn\u2019t leave the reel in clumps causing line knots.\nP3 epitomizes Shimano\u2019s goals with this range of fishing reels-Power, Precision, and Performance. Power comes from the smooth and strong gears and drag, while Precision is demonstrated in the accurate line lay and tight tolerances, and Performance is the combination of all of the features found in the Shimano Hyperloop, showing these reels to be an excellent choice for those looking for a great value entry-level fishing reel.\nWith a fishing line capacity of 183m of 3kg line, the 2500 Shimano Hyperloop fishing reel is aimed at the lighter styles of fishing, fish such as bream, whiting, bass, and trout, perfect for those looking to wet a line with the family. And with the line already spooled, this reel is ready to go straight away.\n\nFeatures:\n\nGreat small-sized fishing reel suitable for light fishing such as lakes, bays, rivers, and more\n\n\nDyna-Balance\n\n\nAerowave line lay\n\n\nGraphite spool and body\n\n\nPower roller\n\n\nP3\nReel Comes without Box.\n\nNote: Comes with pre-spooled line.\nSpecification\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\nLineCapacity(lb/yds)\n\n\nPowerPro LineCapacity(m/mm)\n\nBearings\n\nMax Drag(Kg)\n\nGear Ratio\n\n\u00a0 Weight\n\n\n\nHL 6000FB\n\n10/300\u00a0 \u00a0 12/265\u00a0 \u00a0 14/210\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 20/120\n\n0.30/270 0.35/240 0.40/140 0.45/110\n1\n6\n4.9:1\n500g\n\n\n",

The Digigear&amp;nbsp; type gearing is smooth and powerful aiding retrieval of both gear and fish.\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFEATURES:\n\nATD Automatic Drag System clutch\nHard Bodyz body in anodized aluminum\nBraid Ready Design Spool\nMagsealed technology\nATD Automatic Drag System clutch with carbon discs\nDigigear&amp;nbsp; technology\n6 Ball bearings, 1 Roller\n\n\u00a0\n\nSPECIFICATION:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nModel\nBG3000\nBG4000\n\n\nCapacity Nylon (mm/lb | m/yds)\n\n0.28/8 | 220/240,\u00a0\n0.30/10 | 185/200,\n0.32/12 | 155/170\n\n\n0.30/10 | 270/300,\n0.32/12 | 240/260,\n0.35/14 | 190/210\n\n\n\nCapacity Braid (mm/lb | m/yds)\n\n0.19/15 | 260/280,\n0.23/20 | 220/240,\u00a0\n0.28/30 | 170/190\n\n\n0.23/20 | 340/370,\n0.28/30 | 260/370,\n0.32/40 | 180/200\n\n\n\nGear Ratio\n5.6:1\n\n5.6:1\n\n\nMax Drag (kg)\n7kg/15.4lb\n8kg/17.6lb\n\n\nWeight\u00a0\n315g/11.1oz\n435g/15.3oz\n\n\nRetrieve\n95cm/37.4\"\n101cm/39.9\"\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nBG 4500\nBG 5000\nBG 6500\n\n\n\n0.35/14 | 460/500,\n0.40/17 | 260/280,\n0.45/20 | 190/210\n\n\n0.35/14 | 460/500,\n0.40/17 | 350/380,\n0.45/20 | 260/280\n\n\n0.45/20 | 340/370\n0.50/25 | 280/310\n0.55/30 | 240/260\n\n\n\n\n0.36/40 | 310/340,\n0.40/50 | 250/270,\n0.44/65 | 210/230\n\n\n0.36/40 | 440/480,\n0.40/50 | 330/360,\n0.44/65 | 280/310\n\n\n0.40/50 | 500/550\n0.44/65 | 400/440\n0.50/80 | 300/330\n\n\n\n5.7:1\n5.7:1\n\n5.3:1\n\n\n10kg/22lb\n10kg/22lb\n15kg/33.1lb\n\n\n630g/22.2oz\n645g/22.8oz\n845g/29.8oz\n\n\n109cm/43.1\"\n\n120cm/47.5\"\n123cm/48.8\"\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\nBG 8000\n\n\n\n0.45/20 | 500/550\n0.50/25 | 400/440\n0.55/30 | 340/370\n\n\n\n\n0.44/65 | 540/590\n0.50/80 | 400/440\u00a0\n0.56/100 | 300/330\n\n\n\n5.3:1\n\n\n15kg/33.1lb\n\n\n860g/30.3oz\n\n\n135cm/53.4'\n\n\n",

Since then, the company has grown into one of the largest and most influential tackle companies in the world today. From the very beginning, Daiwa's emphasis has been upon innovation and quality. The result is a long list of product features, design, and materials that have become standards for the fishing tackle industry. It is a long-standing record of innovation, the type of innovation that has left a visible mark on the majority of tackle manufactured today, an innovation that continues to advance the sport of fishing. The next generation of Daiwa's ever-popular BG spinning reel series just got leaner and meaner. This complete series ranges from ultralight freshwater actions to heavy big game saltwater models. Daiwa Black Gold (BG) is equipped with a \"Hard Bodyz\" Body &amp; Side Cover machined aluminum body and body cover providing strength and internal part stability. To increase the strength in the form of corrosion and scratch resistance, Daiwa black anodized the body and body cover. The anodization process allows for better adhesion to the aluminum and will not chip or peel like a painted surface, extending the brilliant look of the BG spinning series.

            "description": "The Shimano NASCI spinning reel is a high-quality fishing reel at an affordable price point that is suitable for both freshwaters as well as light to medium saltwater fishing applications. In the Shimano NASCI reel review, we will look at how Shimano incorporates their Hagane HGN cold-forged gearing and their X-Ship technology for improved power, durability and functionality. This is a 2021 model reel.\nFeaturesOverall, I have to say that I am quite impressed with the quality of this fishing reel at this price point. I have spent hundreds in the past from both Shimano and other manufacturers to get this type of quality. The reel is just silky smooth as I would expect from Shimano, so let\u2019s take a look at all that has been packed into this great reel.\nHagane cold forged gearing \u2013 The Hagane precision cold forged gears provide one of the smoothest retrieve experience you will ever have, especially under a heavy load. X-SHIP provides a smoother and stronger precision gear system that places a bearing on the opinion. While this difference does not make itself apparent when you are in the store under no load, the difference does become apparent rather quickly once adequate pressure has been applied (a big fish). The NASCI comes in both a 5.0:1 and 6.2:1 gear ratio.Coreprotect water resistance \u2013 Coreprotect provides you with 360-degree all-weather water resistance to make sure that this reel will last a lifetime \u2013 if you take care of it.G Free Body \u2013 The center of the mass of the reel has been moved closer to the rod to improve the weight and balance in your hand. What this means is that you can feel the strike better and that you can fight the fish better. Additionally, you will not get tired as easily after a long day on the water = no forearm and wrist fatigue. This design was first utilized in the more expensive Shimano Stella and then the Stradic FK reels.X Ship \u2013 X-Ship is a combination of features that work together to create much greater efficiency. By positioning the pinion gear close to the center line of the large diameter drive gear, more power is transferred from the handle to the rotor. The pinion gear is also supported by two Shimano A-RB roller bearings. This creates more stability and minimizes pinion gear twist and rotor deflection in extreme situations.Thick Bail Wire \u2013 The thick bail wire might not seem like much at first but it does lead to better performance and less chance that the bail will warp over time which then produces sloppier line management and typically leads to wind knots etc. As I have said in the past, make sure that after you cast that you use your hand to close the bail vs snapping it shut with the turn of the handle as this will make your reel last and perform better over time.\nFeatures at a Glance\n\n Hagane cold forged gearing\n\n\n Cold forged handle\n\n\n Composite body\n\n\n 4+1 Ball Bearings\n\n\n Coreprotect water resistance\n\n\n G Free Body\n\n\n X Ship\n\n\n Thick Bail Wire\n\nSpecification \n\n\n\n\nModel\nNAS500FC\nNAS1000FC\nC5000XG\nC4000XG\nC3000HG\n\n\nMono Line Capacity(kg/m)\n1/150\n4/160\n5/150\n4/150\n3/150\n\n\nBraid Line Capacity(lb/yds)\n4/100\n2/100\n20/260\n\n15/230\n\n10/200\n\n\nBall Bearings\u00a0\n3+1\n5+1\n\n5+1\n\n5+1\n5+1\n\n\nMax Drag\n3kg\n3kg\n11.0kg\n11.0kg\n9kg\n\n\nGear Ratio\n5.6:1\n5.1:0\n6:2:1\n\n6.2:1\n6.2:1\n\n\nWeight\n170g\n205g\n305g\n\n285g\n\n240\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0",

            "description": "Penn Conflict CFT3000 And CFT4000 Spinning Reel\nPenn Conflict is moderately weighted and comes with HT-100 drag. It has a metallic body and side plate that allows the angler to maintain a stable gear alignment even when fishing under difficult conditions.The reel comes with a techno-balanced \u2122 rotor responsible for the reels balanced and smooth retrieve. This is one of the reels in the market with a super line spool \u2122, and which requires no backing because the rubber gasket does not allow any form of slipping. It is indeed a great reel with a super strong drag that guarantees a great casting distance.\n\u00a0\nFeaturesFull Metal Body \u2013 The Penn Conflict models CFT5000, CFT6000 and CFT8000 are the only models that are reported to have a full metal body, however upon inspection of the smaller series reels, I can attest that they all appear to have a full metal body, side plate and rotor just like the Penn Battle II.7+1 Bearing system \u2013 This reel incorporates what is referred to as a 7+1 sealed stainless steel ball bearing system as compared to the Battle II that has a 6+1 bearing system. There are 2 on the main gear, 2 on the pinion gear, 2 on the handle knob and one under the main drag on the top of the spool that reduces the friction when the drag is paying out. All bearing is sealed with rubber seals which should hold up well and protect the reel from accidental dunks in the water.Techno-Balanced rotor \u2013 The Techno-Balanced rotor is a trademarked rotor design of Penn and is engineered to provide a very smooth retrieve. When combined with the 7+1 bearing system, it makes the reel feel silky smooth.HT-100 carbon fiber drag washers \u2013 HT 100 drag system \u2013 which utilizes keyed carbon washers in place of the traditional felt washers will lengthen the lifespan of the reel and provide a very smooth non-jerky drag when under load from a retreating fish. By using a keyed washer, there is access to both sides of the washer to provide a smooth drag. The HT stands for the High Tech which is a carbon fiber laminated on fiberglass. The 100 in the name stands for the equivalent of 100 miles of a line being taken from the reel in original testing without any noticeable degradation which is pretty impressive.Infinite Anti-Reverse \u2013 The infinite Anti Reverse eliminates the back play on the rotor when you set the hook. This is accomplished by using a one way bearing in the reel design.Heavy-duty aluminum bail wire \u2013 The Penn Conflict has an extra heavy duty bail wire that will withstand the test of time and should not warp over a long period of time. This is important as a warped bail will lead to inferior line management.Superline Spool line capacity rings \u2013 The super spool incorporates rubber inlayed into the spool which means that you can go direct to the spool with a braid of your choice without having to back it with mono. I really like this feature and we are starting to see it on more and more reels these days.\u00a0\nThis reel also has full line capacity rings which are marked at 1/3 and 2/3 and is\u00a0Manufactured in America.\n\nSpecifications:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nModel\nCFT3000\nCFT4000\n\n\nMono Capacity (lb/yds)\n8/200, 10/165, 12/120\n8/270, 10/220, 12/165\n\n\nBraid Capacity (lb/yds)\n15/250, 20/180, 30/130\n15/360, 20/260, 30/185\n\n\nBearings\n7+1\n7+1\n\n\nMax Drag (lbs)\n15\n15\n\n\nGear Ratio\n6.2:1\n6.2:1\n\n\nLine Retrieve (inches)\n35\n37\n\n\nWeight (oz)\n11.3oz/ 321g\n12.1oz/ 340g\n\n\n",

The compact XGT-7 body has a changed center of gravity, which makes them comfortable for newcomers to fishing to use, while three ball bearing and one roller bearing combine with Dyna-Balance to make winding delightfully smooth. There are three general purpose sizes: 1000, 2500 and 4000, which cover all manner of light line situations, from bait fishing to Squidgy soft plastic and hardbody lure casting. They punch out 8.5kg drag and the AR-C die-cast aluminum spools hold a generous amount of monofilament and a lot more of a braid. So if you\u2019re just starting out in fishing or the kids are showing some interest that requires something more sophisticated than just a basic handline, check out the new Sienna reel.\nFeatures:\n\nAR-C Spool\n\n\nBall bearings 3+1\n\n\n Specification \n\n\n\n\nModel\nSienna 500\nSienna 1000\nSienna 2500\nSienna 4000\n\n\n\nMono Capacity\n(#test/yd)\n\n0.6/185, 0.8/140, 1/110\n2/270, 4/140, 6/110\n6/200, 8/140, 10/120\n8/240, 10/200, 12/160\n\n\nRetrieve per crank\n\n69\n61\n71\n82\n\n\nMax Drag\n2kg\n3kg\n4kg\n8.5kg\n\n\nGear Ratio\n5.6:1\n5.0:1\n6.2:1\n5.2:1\n\n\nBall Bearings\n3+1\n3+1\n3+1\n3+1\n\n\nWeight\n180g/6.3oz\n205g/7.02oz\n250g/8.8oz\n320g/11.3oz\n\n\n",
