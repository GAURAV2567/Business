            "description": "Daiwa BG MQ 8000 -14000H Spinning Reels\nDescription:\nDaiwa\u2019s BG series has changed the game of what affordable quality looks like in heavy-duty spinning reels. Now, by combining Monocoque Body (MQ) technology with the mass market appeal of BG, 20 BG MQ is born.\nMonocoque Body (MQ) is the single biggest revolution in spinning reel design from Daiwa by totally eliminating the traditional two-piece body construction. MQ reels don\u2019t use any side plates and feature a\u00a0completely screwless body design which eliminates potential entry points for water &amp; grime, and significantly enhances overall body strength and rigidity.\u00a0\nThe screwless design principle of MQ bodies are also significantly more compact than a standard body design. Screws need material to grip to, and that means more overall size and more mass in traditional body designs. By replacing the side plate with a machined aluminium engine plate which screws directly into the reel body, MQ reels can maximise the internal space made available by using larger size drive gears than before.\nThroughout the entire line-up of BG MQ, vast improvements have been made to almost all areas of the reel design. The drag has been improved both in maximum capacity but also in smooth overall performance, drastically reducing the friction of the Carbon ATD drag - BG MQ\u2019s drag performance is unmatched by the competition.\nThe MQ body construction not only has\u00a0the obvious benefits of a stronger &amp; more compact body design, it also delivers an increase in gear durability thanks to absolute zero movement of drivetrain components once installed inside an MQ body. Weather-sealing is also significantly improved, with seals visible in multiple locations throughout the reel, BG MQ is built for the harshest of environments.\nCasting performance has also been improved with the implementation of Long Cast ABS (LC-ABS) spool design. LC-ABS spool design improves line flow from the spool, resulting in increased casting distances across the board with both heavy &amp; light lines.\nThroughout the BG MQ range, improvements have been made specific to the size of each reel to maximise their performance and overall appeal to each target market.\nSmall size BG MQ (2500-4000) feature dramatically larger sized drive gears. Middle sized models 5000 &amp; 6000 now feature the Rigid Air Rotor design, maximising strength and appeal for mid-weight sportfishing applications. Larger size BG MQ from 8000-20000 receive huge benefits as a result of the MQ body, with the leg &amp; main body drastically increased in strength without increasing weight.\nBG MQ marks a new era in affordable saltwater spinning reels from Daiwa, with MQ technology now available to the masses. BG MQ is built for the harshest conditions and is set to once again revolutionise the industry. Available from 2500-20000 size, BG MQ is now aligned with 20 SALTIGA sizing.\nFeatures:\n\n\nABS LONGCAST\nCompared to conventional spools, the LC-ABS has been shown to increase the average flight distance by approx. 5% due to its reduced weight and modified shape.\n\n\nATD DRAG\nDaiwa's Automatic Tournament Drag uses an improved drag grease that exhibits a low viscosity at rest, yet becomes more viscous immediately after drag start up. This reduces initial drag start-up inertia and combined with the structural changes of the ATD Drag System results in a smoother drag from the initial hook up.\n\n\nMETAL ALLOY BODY\nRock solid in strength and performance, alloy is tailor made for Australian conditions and allows a reel to be created that is light, yet strong, and supremely rigid and highly corrosion resistant.\n\n\nMONOCOQUE (MQ)\nA one-piece frame eliminates the use of traditional two-piece body &amp; sideplate construction. A single piece body utilises a screw-in engine plate to house the main gear, reducing flex and twist under load creating a sealed mechanism. The elimination of the side plate also has also allowed for a more compact body design. MQ technology not only makes reels stronger &amp; better sealed, but also more compact.\n\n\nSpecifications:\n\n\n\nModel No\n20 BG MQ 8000-H\n20 BG MQ 10000-H\n20 BG MQ 14000-H\n\n\nGear Ratio\n5.7:1\n5.7:1\n5.7:1\n\n\nWeight (g/oz)\n635g\n646g\n640g\n\n\nMax Drag (kg/lb)\n15kg\n15kg\n15kg\n\n\nBall Bearings\n6BB; 1RB\n6BB; 1RB\n6BB; 1RB\n\n\n\nSpool Capacity\n\nPE 4/300m\nPE 5/300m\nPE 6/300m\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0",

            "description": "\nIt is introducing the new Saltist MQ reel, equipped with a single-piece aluminum Monocoque body designed to withstand the tough conditions of Australian saltwater fishing and the hardy fish in these waters. One of Daiwa's most renowned features, Magseal, combines with the MQ body to create a reel that is well-protected from the harsh marine environment. The larger diameter Tough Digigear, housed in the single piece Monocoque body, transfers power delivered through the handle to your line, enabling you to stop even the strongest fish in their tracks.\u00a0\nIn addition, Saltist MQ features a tubular hollow Air Bail, which enhances line management and improves line flow back into the line roller, providing unmatched performance even in windy conditions with the lightest braids. With a comprehensive size range from 2500 up to 20000, there is a Saltist MQ reel suitable for every fishing location in the country. Whether you're casting lures or dropping baits for reef species and pelagics, or fishing in coastal estuaries and rivers, Saltist MQ has got you covered.\u00a0\nAll Saltist MQ models now come with the Aluminium Round Knob, providing superior grip and stability. If you're in the market for a new saltwater spinning reel that can handle the toughest conditions, look no further than the brand-new Saltist MQ.\nProduct Features:\u00a0\nMonocoque (MQ) \u2013 One Piece Body\nMQ Body takes reel design to the next level. The MQ system does not require conventional side plate, instead using an engine plate to screw directly to the body. Eliminating the need for screws to hold a body cover in place. MQ body improves the strength of the reel, it also improves the water resistance of the body and allows a larger diameter drive gear to be installed.\nABS-Longcast \u2013 Long Cast Spool Technology\nCompared to conventional spools, the LC-ABS has been shown to increase the average flight distance by approx. 5% due to its reduced weight and modified shape.\nAir-Bail\nDaiwa\u2019s innovative bail design features a hollow tubular stainless steel bail that delivers maximum rigidity and strength with minimum weight. Featuring a smooth protrusion-free design and construction line easily slides unencumbered along the Air Bail towards the line roller for trouble-free line control.\nAir-Rotor \u2013 Lightweight Rotor\nLighter, stronger, and more balanced than any rotor system that\u2019s come before, \u2018Air Rotor\u2019 delivers a great leap forward in rotor design and function and delivers the ultimate line roller support. Made from Zaion and featuring a redesigned arch that disperses pressure to the lower section of the rotor to reduce stressing and flexing, the design is further enhanced with a hollowed-out construction reducing weight, while increasing reel sensitivity and rotational balance.\nATD-Drag \u2013 Automatic Tournament Drag\nDaiwa\u2019s Automatic Tournament Drag uses an improved drag grease that exhibits a low viscosity at rest, yet becomes more viscous immediately after drag start-up. This reduces initial drag start-up inertia and combined with the structural changes of the ATD Drag System results in a smoother drag from the initial hook-up.\nMachine Cut Handle\nOur new handle design is slimmer, more compact, and 50% lighter.\u00a0\nInfinite Anti Reverse\nDaiwa's advanced system that limits rearward back play handle movement to almost zero for solid hooksets with less shock to the reel. The result is the elimination of handle slap-back and the unwanted release of line.\nMagsealed-Body\nUltimate protection is delivered to the engine room of the reel with a magnetised oil seal located on the main shaft of the reel\u2019s rotor shutting the door to the elements and unwanted intruders. Dust, water, and salt intrusion into the inner workings of a reel are a thing of the past with MagSeal.\nMetal Ball Knob\nProviding maximum contact between the handle knob and the hand, ball knobs are designed for optimal rotation balance, rotation, and functionality.\nMetal Alloy Body\nRock solid in strength and performance, the alloy is tailor made for Australian conditions and allows a reel to be created that is light, yet strong, supremely rigid and highly corrosion resistant.\nPerfect Line Stopper \u2013 Improved Line Clip Design\nOur new larger rectangular flexible clip can be used from all line angles and from light to heavy lines.\n\nSpecification\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nModel.

If you are a competition angler, or fish using a float or feeder, and want a reel to match your ability, the Aero XR is the solution. All of the reels balance perfectly with Shimano\u2019s best Aero X5, X7 and Pro match and feeder rods, giving you an enviable combination that offer a competitive advantage. With their super smooth waterproof drags, and an additional anti-reverse facility, you can play fish directly off the drag when using stronger lines, by back-winding when using fine lines, or by using a combination of both.\u00a0\n\u00a0The larger 5000 model has an additional reducer for use with braid when feeder fishing at long range. Power is delivered by a very direct screw in handle and a metal line clip, that is strong and line-safe, reinforces the XR\u2019s feeder fishing pedigree.Visually, the understated \u2018stealth-like\u2019 looks of the Aero XR are stunning and combined with the advanced engineering technology can\u2019t fail to inspire your confidence to perform at the highest level.\n\n\nHAGANE GEAR\n\nWith amazing strength and durability, the HAGANE Gear is at the very heart of most Shimano reels. Shimano, through the application of state-of-the-art technologies, gives anglers the long-lasting smoothness and enjoyment that is felt when anglers first use a reel, over and over again. No cutting work is applied to the teeth of the drive gear during fabrication; instead, the entire surface is calculated in minute detail by a special 3D design and then formed by Shimano's cold-forging technology.

            "description": "Okuma Helios SX spinning reels are constructed of C-40X carbon and the TORSION CONTROL ARMOR\u00ae design make the reel extremely rigid and lighter, also reduce twist and torque and keep the internal parts in perfect alignment for freshwater and inshore saltwater fishing.\nFeatures\n\nLight weight C-40X carbon frame and side plates\nC-40X Cyclonic Flow Rotor for corrosion resistance\nTCA\u2122: TORSION CONTROL ARMOR\u00ae reduces twisting\n8HPB + 1RB corrosion resistant stainless steel bearings\nQuick-Set anti-reverse roller bearing\nPrecision machine cut brass pinion gear\nALG: Precision Aluminites alloy main gear and oscillating gears\nRigid, machined aluminum, anodized handle\nLight weight, EVA handle knobs for comfort\nPrecision Elliptical Gearing system\nMachined aluminum, 2-tone anodized spool\nHeavy duty, solid aluminum bail wire\nRESII: Computer balanced Rotor Equalizing System\nLCS line control spool\n\n\n\n\nCentrifugal Disc Bail (CDB)\nThe Centrifugal Disc Bail (CDB) design incorporates a heavier brass disc that is perfectly weighted and balanced to create smoother bail operations. CDB increases the strength and stability of bail functions.\n\n\n\n\nProgressive Drag\nOkuma\u2019s 1-K woven carbon fiber drag knob is light weight and creates progressive drag settings. Our progressive drag allows you to customize settings to specific conditions and fish or adjust your drag during a long fight.\n\n\n\n\nC-40X\nOkuma\u2019s C-40X long strand carbon fiber technology utilizes a special blended graphite polymer. The carbon fibers in this material are elongated and reinforced, which creates a substantially stronger composite than standard graphite. At 25% lighter, 50% stronger and 100% anti-corrosive, C-40X translates into an extremely lightweight and durably constructed.\n\n\n\n\nCyclonic Flow Rotor (CFR)\nCyclonic Flow Rotor (CFR) was designed to create \u201ccyclonic\u201d airflow, which significantly increases air around the rotor, beneath and around the spool, with every turn of the handle. This thoroughly tested design allows for a much faster drying time if the reel becomes wet, minimizing corrosion and extending longevity of the reel.\n\n\n\n\nTORSION CONTROL ARMOR\u00ae (TCA\u2122)\nThe one-piece TCA\u2122 design was built using Okuma C-40X carbon fiber technology and made with a double arm design. Compared to traditional single side designs, TCA\u2122\u2019s double arm offers higher torsion and flex resistance under heavy pressure for improved strength. This not only makes the reel lighter but also extremely rigid ensuring the internal parts stays in perfect alignment.\n\n\n\nSpecifications:\n\n\n\nModel No.\n\nGear Ratio\n\nBearings\nMax Drag\nWeight\n\nLine retrieve (cm)\nLine Capacity\n\n\n\nHSX-40\n\n5.0:1\n\n8HPB + 1RB\n6kg\n\n262g\n\n76.2cm\n0.25/260, 0.30/180, 0.35/130\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "The CATANA FE is the latest version of a Shimano classic. Offering exceptional value for money, the CATANA is a freshwater and inshore saltwater spinning reel that can be used for all kinds of freshwater fishing.\nIf you are looking for a freshwater spinning reel at a very affordable price, the CATANA FE is one option you should not ignore. \nIdeal for a wide range of fishing, from lightweight and medium-sized lures, to match and feeder fishing, the understated appearance looks fantastic and the performance is remarkable for a reel of this price. Pair the CATANA with any low and mid-priced Shimano rod and you have a great combination that you will be proud to own and use. In use, you\u2019ll immediately notice the improved balance produced by Shimano\u2019s latest G-Free body design. \nThis body design is to be found on the very best Shimano reels and makes fishing easier over a long period of time. The smoothness you\u2019ll feel comes from a combination of 3 Shimano Stainless Steel Ball Bearings plus a Roller Bearing, which ensures trouble-free performance, even when playing the largest fish. Like top-of-the-range Shimano reels, the aluminum spool has an AR-C design, which combined with Varispeed II line lay improves casting distance and accuracy, with both mono and braided lines. \nPerhaps the most difficult decision you\u2019ll have to make is which CATANA size to choose. There are 7 models, including fast speed \u2018HG\u2019 versions, ranging from the smallest 1000 size suitable for lightweight \u2018finesse\u2019 fishing up to the largest 4000 size which is perfect for larger lures and heavy feeder fishing. Whichever you choose, the CATANA is guaranteed to give you many hours of fishing fun and excitement.\n\n\n\n Specification \n\n\n\n\nModel\nCAT 4000\u00a0\n\n\nNylon spool capacity(m/mm)\n180/0.30\n\n\nBearings\n3+1\n\n\nMax Drag\n8.5kg\n\n\nGear Ratio\n5.2:1\n\n\nWeight\n320g/11.3oz\n\n\n",

            "description": "\nShimano Hyperloop Spinning Reel\n\nThe Hyperloop features classical styling along with high-tech features such as Super Stopper and Varispeed line lay. By turning the handle you can immediately appreciate the quality of the gears, and vibration is almost eliminated by Shimano\u2019s Dyna Balance system. The Hyperloop also incorporates a Power Roller that keeps line twist to a minimum. Whereas the smaller models in this series are designed for all types of fishing such as spinning, float, feeder, or any other light to medium-heavy styles, the large 6000 size is an ideal model for heavy-duty spinning, bottom fishing or light surf casting.\n\nThe Shimano Hyperloop is a great value reel that will provide long service with minimal issues. Some of the features found on the Shimano Hyperloop 2500 fishing reel are the same features that are found on more expensive Shimano fishing reels.\nHaving Dyna-Balance, the Hyperloop doesn\u2019t wobble around when winding, and the Aerowave feature ensures that the line lays properly and doesn\u2019t leave the reel in clumps causing line knots.\nP3 epitomizes Shimano\u2019s goals with this range of fishing reels-Power, Precision, and Performance. Power comes from the smooth and strong gears and drag, while Precision is demonstrated in the accurate line lay and tight tolerances, and Performance is the combination of all of the features found in the Shimano Hyperloop, showing these reels to be an excellent choice for those looking for a great value entry-level fishing reel.\nWith a fishing line capacity of 183m of 3kg line, the 2500 Shimano Hyperloop fishing reel is aimed at the lighter styles of fishing, fish such as bream, whiting, bass, and trout, perfect for those looking to wet a line with the family. And with the line already spooled, this reel is ready to go straight away.\n\nFeatures:\n\nGreat small-sized fishing reel suitable for light fishing such as lakes, bays, rivers, and more\n\n\nDyna-Balance\n\n\nAerowave line lay\n\n\nGraphite spool and body\n\n\nPower roller\n\n\nP3\nReel Comes without Box.\n\nNote: Comes with pre-spooled line.\nSpecification\n\n\n\n\nModel\n\nLineCapacity(lb/yds)\n\n\nPowerPro LineCapacity(m/mm)\n\nBearings\n\nMax Drag(Kg)\n\nGear Ratio\n\n\u00a0 Weight\n\n\n\nHL 6000FB\n\n10/300\u00a0 \u00a0 12/265\u00a0 \u00a0 14/210\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 20/120\n\n0.30/270 0.35/240 0.40/140 0.45/110\n1\n6\n4.9:1\n500g\n\n\n",

Since then, the company has grown into one of the largest and most influential tackle companies in the world today. From the very beginning, Daiwa's emphasis has been upon innovation and quality. The result is a long list of product features, design, and materials that have become standards for the fishing tackle industry. It is a long-standing record of innovation, the type of innovation that has left a visible mark on the majority of tackle manufactured today, an innovation that continues to advance the sport of fishing. The next generation of Daiwa's ever-popular BG spinning reel series just got leaner and meaner. This complete series ranges from ultralight freshwater actions to heavy big game saltwater models. Daiwa Black Gold (BG) is equipped with a \"Hard Bodyz\" Body &amp; Side Cover machined aluminum body and body cover providing strength and internal part stability. To increase the strength in the form of corrosion and scratch resistance, Daiwa black anodized the body and body cover. The anodization process allows for better adhesion to the aluminum and will not chip or peel like a painted surface, extending the brilliant look of the BG spinning series. Digi-Gear Digital gear design. Daiwa BG spinning series have integrated the largest drive gear in the history of Daiwa spinning reels.

            "description": "The Shimano NASCI spinning reel is a high-quality fishing reel at an affordable price point that is suitable for both freshwaters as well as light to medium saltwater fishing applications. In the Shimano NASCI reel review, we will look at how Shimano incorporates their Hagane HGN cold-forged gearing and their X-Ship technology for improved power, durability and functionality. This is a 2021 model reel.\nFeaturesOverall, I have to say that I am quite impressed with the quality of this fishing reel at this price point. I have spent hundreds in the past from both Shimano and other manufacturers to get this type of quality. The reel is just silky smooth as I would expect from Shimano, so let\u2019s take a look at all that has been packed into this great reel.\nHagane cold forged gearing \u2013 The Hagane precision cold forged gears provide one of the smoothest retrieve experience you will ever have, especially under a heavy load. X-SHIP provides a smoother and stronger precision gear system that places a bearing on the opinion. While this difference does not make itself apparent when you are in the store under no load, the difference does become apparent rather quickly once adequate pressure has been applied (a big fish). The NASCI comes in both a 5.0:1 and 6.2:1 gear ratio.Coreprotect water resistance \u2013 Coreprotect provides you with 360-degree all-weather water resistance to make sure that this reel will last a lifetime \u2013 if you take care of it.G Free Body \u2013 The center of the mass of the reel has been moved closer to the rod to improve the weight and balance in your hand. What this means is that you can feel the strike better and that you can fight the fish better. Additionally, you will not get tired as easily after a long day on the water = no forearm and wrist fatigue. This design was first utilized in the more expensive Shimano Stella and then the Stradic FK reels.X Ship \u2013 X-Ship is a combination of features that work together to create much greater efficiency. By positioning the pinion gear close to the center line of the large diameter drive gear, more power is transferred from the handle to the rotor. The pinion gear is also supported by two Shimano A-RB roller bearings. This creates more stability and minimizes pinion gear twist and rotor deflection in extreme situations.Thick Bail Wire \u2013 The thick bail wire might not seem like much at first but it does lead to better performance and less chance that the bail will warp over time which then produces sloppier line management and typically leads to wind knots etc. As I have said in the past, make sure that after you cast that you use your hand to close the bail vs snapping it shut with the turn of the handle as this will make your reel last and perform better over time.\nFeatures at a Glance\n\n Hagane cold forged gearing\n\n\n Cold forged handle\n\n\n Composite body\n\n\n 4+1 Ball Bearings\n\n\n Coreprotect water resistance\n\n\n G Free Body\n\n\n X Ship\n\n\n Thick Bail Wire\n\nSpecification \n\n\n\n\nModel\nNAS500FC\nNAS1000FC\nC5000XG\nC4000XG\nC3000HG\n\n\nMono Line Capacity(kg/m)\n1/150\n4/160\n5/150\n4/150\n3/150\n\n\nBraid Line Capacity(lb/yds)\n4/100\n2/100\n20/260\n\n15/230\n\n10/200\n\n\nBall Bearings\u00a0\n3+1\n5+1\n\n5+1\n\n5+1\n5+1\n\n\nMax Drag\n3kg\n3kg\n11.0kg\n11.0kg\n9kg\n\n\nGear Ratio\n5.6:1\n5.1:0\n6:2:1\n\n6.2:1\n6.2:1\n\n\nWeight\n170g\n205g\n305g\n\n285g\n\n240\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0",

            "description": "Penn Conflict CFT3000 And CFT4000 Spinning Reel\nPenn Conflict is moderately weighted and comes with HT-100 drag. It has a metallic body and side plate that allows the angler to maintain a stable gear alignment even when fishing under difficult conditions.The reel comes with a techno-balanced \u2122 rotor responsible for the reels balanced and smooth retrieve. This is one of the reels in the market with a super line spool \u2122, and which requires no backing because the rubber gasket does not allow any form of slipping. It is indeed a great reel with a super strong drag that guarantees a great casting distance.\n\u00a0\nFeaturesFull Metal Body \u2013 The Penn Conflict models CFT5000, CFT6000 and CFT8000 are the only models that are reported to have a full metal body, however upon inspection of the smaller series reels, I can attest that they all appear to have a full metal body, side plate and rotor just like the Penn Battle II.7+1 Bearing system \u2013 This reel incorporates what is referred to as a 7+1 sealed stainless steel ball bearing system as compared to the Battle II that has a 6+1 bearing system. There are 2 on the main gear, 2 on the pinion gear, 2 on the handle knob and one under the main drag on the top of the spool that reduces the friction when the drag is paying out. All bearing is sealed with rubber seals which should hold up well and protect the reel from accidental dunks in the water.Techno-Balanced rotor \u2013 The Techno-Balanced rotor is a trademarked rotor design of Penn and is engineered to provide a very smooth retrieve. When combined with the 7+1 bearing system, it makes the reel feel silky smooth.HT-100 carbon fiber drag washers \u2013 HT 100 drag system \u2013 which utilizes keyed carbon washers in place of the traditional felt washers will lengthen the lifespan of the reel and provide a very smooth non-jerky drag when under load from a retreating fish. By using a keyed washer, there is access to both sides of the washer to provide a smooth drag. The HT stands for the High Tech which is a carbon fiber laminated on fiberglass. The 100 in the name stands for the equivalent of 100 miles of a line being taken from the reel in original testing without any noticeable degradation which is pretty impressive.Infinite Anti-Reverse \u2013 The infinite Anti Reverse eliminates the back play on the rotor when you set the hook. This is accomplished by using a one way bearing in the reel design.Heavy-duty aluminum bail wire \u2013 The Penn Conflict has an extra heavy duty bail wire that will withstand the test of time and should not warp over a long period of time. This is important as a warped bail will lead to inferior line management.Superline Spool line capacity rings \u2013 The super spool incorporates rubber inlayed into the spool which means that you can go direct to the spool with a braid of your choice without having to back it with mono. I really like this feature and we are starting to see it on more and more reels these days.\u00a0\nThis reel also has full line capacity rings which are marked at 1/3 and 2/3 and is\u00a0Manufactured in America.\n\nSpecifications:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nModel\nCFT3000\nCFT4000\n\n\nMono Capacity (lb/yds)\n8/200, 10/165, 12/120\n8/270, 10/220, 12/165\n\n\nBraid Capacity (lb/yds)\n15/250, 20/180, 30/130\n15/360, 20/260, 30/185\n\n\nBearings\n7+1\n7+1\n\n\nMax Drag (lbs)\n15\n15\n\n\nGear Ratio\n6.2:1\n6.2:1\n\n\nLine Retrieve (inches)\n35\n37\n\n\nWeight (oz)\n11.3oz/ 321g\n12.1oz/ 340g\n\n\n",

            "description": "Shimano SIENNA Spinning Reel\nDescription:\nSienna spin reels have been part and parcel of the Shimano lineup for well over a dozen years now, and the latest incarnation certainly raises the standard when it comes to entry-level performance. The compact XGT-7 body has a changed center of gravity, which makes them comfortable for newcomers to fishing to use, while three ball bearing and one roller bearing combine with Dyna-Balance to make winding delightfully smooth. There are three general purpose sizes: 1000, 2500 and 4000, which cover all manner of light line situations, from bait fishing to Squidgy soft plastic and hardbody lure casting. They punch out 8.5kg drag and the AR-C die-cast aluminum spools hold a generous amount of monofilament and a lot more of a braid. So if you\u2019re just starting out in fishing or the kids are showing some interest that requires something more sophisticated than just a basic handline, check out the new Sienna reel.\nFeatures:\n\nAR-C Spool\n\n\nBall bearings 3+1\n\n\n Specification \n\n\n\n\nModel\nSienna 500\nSienna 1000\nSienna 2500\nSienna 4000\n\n\n\nMono Capacity\n(#test/yd)\n\n0.6/185, 0.8/140, 1/110\n2/270, 4/140, 6/110\n6/200, 8/140, 10/120\n8/240, 10/200, 12/160\n\n\nRetrieve per crank\n\n69\n61\n71\n82\n\n\nMax Drag\n2kg\n3kg\n4kg\n8.5kg\n\n\nGear Ratio\n5.6:1\n5.0:1\n6.2:1\n5.2:1\n\n\nBall Bearings\n3+1\n3+1\n3+1\n3+1\n\n\nWeight\n180g/6.3oz\n205g/7.02oz\n250g/8.8oz\n320g/11.3oz\n\n\n",

This groundbreaking development offers superior quality at an economical cost. Indra\u2122, India's own fishing rod, is a remarkable milestone for the angling community.\nIt took us nearly two years to develop a multi-purpose rod with high-quality blank and Fuji components. Our aim was to make a rod suitable for targeting hard-fighting game fish in India's fresh and saltwater ecosystems, while remaining affordable. We fine-tuned each part of the rod during the creation process to make it a super versatile tool for anglers. Our field testers have thoroughly tested the rod, catching species like Mahaseer, Murrel, Mulley, Barramundi, MJ, Grouper and Rawas. At last, the Indra rod is available and can be shipped across India.\nLightweight high- and mid-modulus blank, ergonomic \"Hard Eva Grip\", Fuij \"MNOG Super Ocean\" guides, medium-heavy action, stylish aesthetics and prints, reliable rod cover - all in one rod.\nSpecifications:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel no\nIND-CARP-12\n\n\nLength\n12ft\n\n\nSection\n3\n\n\nTest curve\n3.25lb\n\n\n\nMade in Vietnam",

Built around a 24-ton carbon blank, the Ceymar Inshore Series utilizes Okuma's proprietary UFR: Ultimate Flex Reinforced rod tip technology to provide best-in-class durability. UFR technology blends unidirectional fiber over 24-ton carbon in the tip section of the rod to dramatically increase lifting strength and power without adding weight and negatively impacting balance. The blanks are wrapped with corrosion-resistant stainless steel guide frames with titanium oxide inserts for the smooth casting of both monofilament and braided lines.

            "description": "\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPursuing action response and ease of use\n\nThe fins attached to the jaws dramatically improve the response of the dog-walking action. It can act firmly even in windy, current-driven, and wavy conditions, expanding the range of fishing techniques. It is also easy to make the lure move, regardless of the angler's experience level, allowing you to experience the fun of manipulating a top water plug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA versatile all-rounder\n\nBy adjusting the line tension and input strength during the dog walk, you can search a wide area with a good tempo by sliding the lure wide, or you can restrict the sliding width and lure the lure by shaking its head tenaciously at one point. Popping has very few errors and troubles, and the sweet popping sound calls to fish over a wide area, making it an effective appeal in rough water conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore than 50m flying distance\n\nThe design concentrates the volume and center of gravity on the tail side, allowing for long-distance casting with a stable flying posture. It achieves an outstanding average flight distance of 52.2m*, putting unexplored spots within range and being useful both onshore and offshore. *Average flight distance of 5 casts when using a PE 0.6, leader 10lb, and 7ft 7inch rod. Measured by our company.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures:-\n\n\n\nFins at the throat\n\nIt cuts through the water sharply when doing dog-walking and improves the ability to move straight to the left and right. It is the key part that gives Toppy its distinctive features of high operability and ease of action.\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHighly functional body shape\n\nAt first glance, the body looks like a toy, but the thick tail allows it to carry weight and rectify the wind, dramatically increasing the casting distance. Also, black porgy have a tendency to miss bites when the action slides too much, so the thick tail brakes it and keeps the sliding width to a minimum, increasing the hooking rate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStanding posture\n\nMost of the body is submerged in water, so it is less likely to bounce off when bitten, reducing missed bites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFront hook eye positioned slightly further back\n\nIt is located just a little behind the center of the body, in an excellent position to prevent it from getting tangled with the line or snapping even when you turn your head or pop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeardrop-shaped line eye\n\nWe've improved the difficulty of threading the snap, which is common with poppers. The teardrop shape allows the folded part at the end of the snap to be threaded easily.\n\u00a0\n\nSpecifications:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nLength\n\nWeight\n\nType\nHook\n\n\nBleeker Toppy\n67mm\nAbout 9g\nFloating\n#8\n\n\n\n",

It is possible to continue using without stress with casting performance that does not face headwinds.\nStable swimming posture and castability, excellent bottom sensing ability. The TN series has characteristics such as good start-response after swimming and fluttering. We have a lineup of 5 sizes of 50/60/65/70/80 and different versions of various internal structures, and as a fishing lure, it has been highly evaluated not only in Japan but also in other countries around the world for many years, including bass. We are proud of our achievements in various game fish in general.\nThe most important feature is the OMS (Out Metal System) equipped with a forming weight that uses a high specific gravity tungsten material set at the mouth. A low center of gravity due to the weight outside the body. It achieves a stable flight action at all speeds from casting, flight attitude and super slow to fast retrieve, and exhibits excellent bottom sensing ability and agile response to reposition.\nIn addition, even if the body size is the same, it will be possible to expand the range of fishing by using various versions such as the original, which is the basis of everything, effective silent under high pressure conditions, heavy bass sound and full tungsten with strong wave.\nEquipped With \"OMS (Out Metal System)\"\nAchieves stable swimming posture and castability by mounting \"OMS (Out Metal System)\".

Solid bodies are effective in such situations. Compared to general hollow body hardbait, there is very little diffused reflection, and it has a sense of transparency and unique texture, allowing even selective rockfish to use their mouths.\n\nAdopts joint structure\n\nAdopts a joint structure that produces a lustrous action like softbait even though it is hardbait. When retrieving slowly, WOBBRING action naturally attracts the fish, and when retrieving quickly, the fast-pitched S-shaped action appeals to the fish.\n\nCompatible with various actions\n\nno-sinker rig design allows for slow fall/retrieval. Based on slow retrieval just below the water surface, a variety of lures are possible, such as lift &amp; fall on the surface/shallow that takes advantage of slow fall, and swinging action that reduces travel distance.\u00a0\n\nsolid body\n\n\n\nThe solid body, which is filled with resin and has no air chambers, has a refractive index close to that of baits such as Shirasu, and by naturally adapting to the water, it exhibits extremely high feeding power.\n\n\n\nno-sinker rig design\n\nThe hook acts as a weight for balance, and there is no-sinker rig inside the body. Since the specific gravity is close to water, it is possible to attack slowly when falling or retrieving just below the water surface, creating a natural floating feeling like a lightweight jig head + softbait. Also, you can make the most of the transparency of the body.\n\nColoring that takes advantage of the solid body\n\nWe have a lineup of 8 clear colors that take advantage of the transparency of the solid body.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecification:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nName\nLength\nWeight\n\nType\u00a0\nHook Size\n\n\nAbbey Solid 55S\n55mm\n2.6g\nSinking\n#14\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "\n\u00a0\nThe Tide Minnow Slim 140 enjoyed its popularity among surf fishing anglers, and the long awaited full model change has arrived. With the modifications on the weight system, the castability has drastically improved. Further, we have adjusted the action and body balance to better suit the ever changing rough conditions in the surf.\nWe have fine tuned its specifications to better suit the surf game today. To put it into perspective, this new model will feel a little like a model between the Tide Minnow Slim 120 and the 175.\nCASTABILITY:\nFor the moving weight system, the original model used a steel ball which attached to a magnet while swimming, whereas the new model changed to a free-moving tungsten ball. In addition to the change in the weight system, we sharpened the outline of the rear end of the body to reduce air-resistance. With the installation of the heavier tungsten ball which transfers more smoothly within the body, we were able to realize a more stable flight posture resulting in a 10% increase in casting distance.\nACTION RESPONSE:\nWhile maintaining the popular rolling action, we increased the lures water catching ability in order for the lure to sustain balance where the water tends to get rough. This helps anglers to easily feel the complicated current in the surf. In other words, the body of the lure wobbles a little wider than the original model resulting in stronger water resistance. The swimming depth is much deeper at approximately 80 ~ 120cm, whereas the original model swam at 50 ~ 80cm.\n\u00a0\n Specifications:\n\n\n\n\nLength\n140mm | 5-1/2inch\n\n\nWeight\n18g | 5/8oz\n\n\nQty/pck\n1\n\n\nHook\n\n#6\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n",

            "description": "With the original 110mm on the market, which was easily controlled to dog-walk by any angler, we have added a model with more emphasis on the \u201cbite\u201d. In addition to the original characteristics of its castability, action and the sphere protruding from its face to improve the rotational performance, a smaller dog-walking action has been added to its values. It will not only be effective in searching a vast area, but will also produce you results in high pressure fields where a tighter approach is required. With the side-to-side dog-walking action inherited from the 110, the pencil 85 will produce a tighter action compared to its predecessor\nCASTING PERFORMANCE:\nThe design of the body form and positioning of the tail hook-eye, reduces the air resistance allowing a stable flight posture. This results in greater casting distance without being affected by wind or casting styles.\nACTION PERFORMANCE:\nWith its swing design, it stages a brisk and compact \u201cdog-walking\u201d action.\nSPLASH &amp; DIVING ACTION:\nBy retrieving the line slag stronger than usual when the lure reaches the highest point during the \u201cdog-walking\u201d, the lure splashes the water forward while diving.\nTWO KNOCK RATTLE SYSTEM:\nBy the moving weight hitting the secured hard spherical weight in the tail section, it creates a high pitch clicking sound.

No matter what water clarity and/or sky conditions you encounter, there\u2019s a color for your day.\nAdding to the bait\u2019s convincing presence are finely crafted features like prominent eyes, molded mouth, gills, pectoral fins and scale patterns and a realistic baitfish profile. Aggressive predators may be less discerning, but when the bite is tough, these convincing details will push indecisive fish over the edge.\nComplementing the Twitch Reaper\u2019s visual appeal, a large internal rattle creates the high-pitch sonic attraction that sounds like a school of nervous baitfish. This sensory stimulant proves effective at calling in fish from afar and exciting those nearby.\nOnce a fish commits, the Twitch Reaper\u2019s grabs hold with an unfailing grip, thanks to a pair of high quality 4X strong treble hooks that won\u2019t straighten out. Solidifying the bait\u2019s design, a sturdy through wire system prevents the hooks from being pulled out \u2014 a failure that can occur with standard hook anchors.

Made from balsa wood combined with carefully placed internal weights, tapered fuselage, and thin tail design creates the ultimate crankbait action, found only in the DT family. Ultra-thin polycarbonate lip digs the bait down quickly to the desired depth with aid of small metal disc permanently embedded in the lip. Swimming with a side-to-side action only balsa crankbaits can achieve, the DT cranks deep, yet pulls with ease. Perfectly weighted to rest in a \u201cquick-dive\u201d nose down position allowing for immediate descent to the desired depth, the DT\u00ae can be easily cast 150 feet. Simply put, the farther the cast, the longer the bait stays in the strike zone. It's the most effective way to cover more water and catch more fish. The internal baritone rattle is tuned for best sound performance. Premiere finishes in all the right color patterns finished with 3D holographic or painted eyes. All come with premium VMC\u00ae black nickel hooks. Each lure is hand-tuned and tank-tested to swim perfectly right out of the box. \n\u00a0Features:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuick-Dive Resting Position\n\n\nExtra Thin Polycarbonate Lip\n\n\nPerfect Balance\n\n\nLong-Casting up to 150 ft.\n\n\nThin Tail Design\n\n\nInternal Rattle Chamber\n\n\nVMC\u00ae Black Nickel Hooks\n\n\nBalsa Wood Construction\n\n\n3D Holographic Eyes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

It was developed industrially respecting the original draw and became a summary of quality and advantages of an ABS housing with millimeter tolerances, typical of the realization in series. It has a traditional walking the dog action, but with a new fluidity and a typical action of a pencil bait, which allows many customizations of the retrieval action. Important details, like the scales in relief, are worthy of an artisan and collectible bait. The \u201cfull wire\u201d armor made of stainless steel and the SW treble hooks of high quality makes it a reliable and high-performance bait for Mediterranean predators such as bluefish, seabass and other small pelagic fish.

Id had problems obtaining this particular lure and saw it on your website. I also wanted the 15cm grey ghost by storm but you didnt have it. My order was dealt with quickly and arrived in good condition. The grouper in the picture still has the storm lure in its mouth. You can see the tip of it. So many thanks",

This makes it a Mouth-Trap for vicious ambush predators, like the unsuspecting barramundi and mangrove jack.This lure is designed for precision casting applications and has a floating body. The LP120STD has sticky sharp, fine gauge forged hooks for great hook sets while retaining superior holding ability. Available in clear and fully painted finishes, the Laser Pro 120STD is taking you back to the future and comes in 1meter diving depths.\n\n\nWhen the Laser Pro 120 is cast, the weights move to the rear of the lure giving a straight trajectory, and upon retrieval, the weights lock in place back towards the front of the lure. The Laser Pro 120 is famous for its incredible action when using the \u201crip and stop\u201d technique.\nPull the lure fast through the water using the rod then retrieve the slackline and repeat it again, this will often attract a strike from even the wariest predators.\nUse the \u201crip and stop\u201d technique on the standard version for explosive surface strikes. Note that when the lure stops moving it is pointing slightly left or right with the nose slightly down. It is in the ideal position for immediate and erratic action when ripped. The Laser Pro 120 is also ideal for a slow retrieve with light twitching movement from the rod tip.\n\n\n",

This means that the moment you start retrieving the lure it dives almost straight down. This makes it ideal for casting to structures where there is limited room and you require the lure to get as deep as possible and as quickly as possible. When casting, the Poltergeist 80 allows the maximum time at a deep depth. When trolling the lure dives deep quickly and travels along at around 5 meters with a shuffling action.The Poltergeist 80 is ideal where the lure is being dragged over a rock bar or shallow area (say 4 meters deep). It will travel over the bottom, hitting it regularly, but when it reaches the other side of the feature (where the water gets deep again) it immediately tries to crash-dive down the other side. This is often where large predatory fish are waiting and this lure dives straight to them. This makes crash divers ideal when trolling from a shallower area over a deep drop off.\n\n",

The \u201cbutterknife\u201d tail aid in easy casting and the lure quickly descends to the depth engraved on the lure bib. When trolling areas of structure, the buoyancy of the lure and the \u201cbutterknife\u201d tail allow the lure to back off any snags after the line has been allowed to slacken off. It may not work every time but is essential when trolling down close to structure that may snag your lure.To achieve an even faster-trolling speed, remove the center hook. If you wish to use heavier hooks, then use Mustad 2/0\u2019s on the front and rear hook hanger. Do not put one on the center hook hanger. It will upset the balance of the lure as well as causing hook meshing.  ",

Though its application has broadened from sea bass to a range of species both in freshwater and in salt. This slim-lined delicacy flies flawlessly over the water during a cast, and rattles and shakes with a wide rolling action just under it. The internal long-cast mechanism doubles as a seductive rattle during a standard retrieve. As a slow rising floater, the Sea Bass Minnow allows anglers to fish heavy structure and plot tactical retrieve courses which allow the lure to pass through many otherwise, forbidding areas - often the habitats of big predatory game fish. Take advantage of the Sea Bass Minnow's aerodynamic design; utilize this lure during circumstances where others may not perform at their peak, such as shore-based angling where casting to likely looking spots may otherwise be out of reach; or when facing a strong headwind - Storm's Sea Bass Minnow cuts through the atmosphere with ease.\n\u00a0\nFeatures:\n\n\n\n\u00a0Rattling slim shaped specialty for sea bass\n\n\nLong cast mechanism with a moving BB\n\n\nSuper sharp VMC hooks\n\n\nWide rolling action on a steady retrieve\n\n\nFast burn &amp; stop to create searching action\n\n\nSlow rising, floating\nComes with 3 treble hooks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0",

The SENSY series of worms/jig heads specializing in this strategy are not only delicate in action, but also easy to handle in the special field of surfing, and a lineup that can be adjusted to a wide range of situations, making them the perfect fit for surf finesse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA wide range of searches that make the most of your appeal\n\nThis is the model with the best searching ability in the series, and the highly responsive tail has a strong action from the moment you start reeling it in, appealing to a wide range of fish. It is particularly useful when searching a wide area as a pilot worm, and also when you need to appeal to a lot of fish, such as when there is a lot of bait.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTail power adjust function\n\nAt the base of the tail, there is a notch that allows you to adjust the action power according to the situation, and by removing that part, you can weaken the power and resistance of the tail one level. This also reduces the lifting, allowing you to adjust the range.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures:-\n\n\n\nA tail that can handle a wide range of flow speeds\n\nIt has a solid action regardless of the weight of the jig head, the strength of the current, or the speed of the retrieve. It has good response that does not stop moving even slowly, and a sense of stability that does not break down even with fast movements.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBody shape for improved lift and distance\n\nThe body shape with a bulging belly has a wide surface area that receives the current and has good floatation, so it can also be used to fish in shallow surf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoft Materials\n\nIt lures with a seductive action and bends easily when bitten, providing outstanding hooking performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGreat with the Sub-Sensitive Jig Head\n\nBy using the Sensey Jig Head, you can maximize all performance including range control, casting distance, and hooking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarkings for easy attachment to jig heads\n\nThe markings on the top of the body are useful as a guide for where to remove the jig head hook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Equipped with a reinforced top line-through harness, the Mulletron LT slides effortlessly up the line after a hookset, erasing the fish\u2019s ability to leverage lure weight to throw hooks. The result is a livebait-like lure with inconceivable hookset and landing percentages. Rounded, wedge-shaped tail activates lure\u2019s realistic swimming action at all retrieve speeds, including extra slow for sluggish fish. Custom, heavy-duty 3/0 (4.5\u201d) and 5/0 (6\u201d) black nickel, sickle hooks bolster strength, penetration and hookset-to-land ratio. Balanced, weighted lure harness combines with buoyant ElaZtech material combine to optimize lure\u2019s natural upright posture while swimming or resting on bottom. Soft yet resilient ElaZtech greatly extends life of lure, even after repeated strikes from aggressive saltwater gamefish. Two sizes, a 4.5-inch (3/4-once) and 6-inch (1-3/4-ounce), each offer a moderately fast rate-of-fall. Available in six fine-tuned baitfish patterns for various water and light conditions.\n\nUltra-realistic mullet profile offered in highly detailed hand-painted and photo-printed color schemes\nReinforced top line-through harness allows bait to slide up line following the hookset, eliminating fish from using weight of bait for leverage to throw hooks\nRounded wedge-shaped tail provides realistic swimming action at a wide range of speeds, including extremely slow retrieves\nConstructed from 10X Tough ElaZtech\u00ae material to withstand repeated strikes from aggressive saltwater gamefish\nCustom heavy-duty 3/0 (4.5\u201d) and 5/0 (6\u201d) sickle-shaped black nickel needlepoint hooks offer the perfect balance of strength and penetration and an excellent hook-to-land ratio\nPerfectly balanced weighted harness and buoyant superplastic material allows the lure to maintain and upright posture on the slowest retrieves, on the fall, and even at rest on the bottom\nModerate sink rate, 4.5\u201d total casting weight is 3/4 oz (1/4 oz internal lead weight), 6\u201d total casting weight is 1-3/4 oz (3/4 oz internal lead weight)\nPainted eyes outlast glue-on eyes most commonly found on large swimbaits\nAvailable in six color patterns tuned for a variety of water and light conditions\n\n\n\n",

Ideal for casting or working vertically, fish it with a constant retrieve or a variety of stop / start retrieves. Best fished with a fast-lifting rod action to create vibration, then allow some slack to let it swim down.\nLift the rod and it vibrates and let it freefall and it swims, there is simply nothing like the\u00a0Vertrex Swim.\nIt is designed to be fished vertically with a fast-lifting rod action to create vibration, followed by giving it slack line to swim down. It can also be cast and used with the same stop / start motion to lift the rod and then allow the lure to freefall and swim.\nThe Vertrex features a full wire internal construction for extra strength and is fitted with the ultimate BKK hooks so you can fish it straight out of the box.\nKey features include:The first soft vibration lure to have a swimming action when free falling.The swimming action is completely random in direction after each lift of the rod. It might swim left, right or any other direction when swimming on the sink and this creates an incredible random action unmatched by any other lure.Swims when dropped under light tension meaning no missed bites.Vibrates when lifted.Ideal for vertical dropping or casting where a stop start retrieve is used to lift the rod and create vibration and then allow the lure to fall and swim.

Its particular shape and the V-tail allows a sinuous and attractive movement, giving this lure various possibilities of use: drop shot presentations, armed with jig heads or with weedless hooks for fishing in areas full of obstacles, and for vertical presentations such as those required by the Pelagic technique. It is erratic if retrieved like a classic walking the dog bait or slow and sinuous while you are researching for the fish. The floating compound with which it is made makes it more visible in the stop phases on the bottom. The RT FORK is equipped with a small pocket where can be entered an insert weight or a rattler to increase its attractive power.\nSpecifications:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nLength\nQuantity/pck\n\n\n10cm/4inch\n4pcs\n\n\n\n12.7cm/5inch\n4pcs\n\n\n",

            "description": "Daiwa Elastomax Bait Junkie Grubz | Size: 4inch | 5pcs/pk\nDescription:\nA single tail grub can be deadly on snapper and\u00a0other saltwater predatory fish, and the BaitJunkie 4\u201d Grub is ready to take on the challenge. The tail design of the 4\u201d Grub differs to the parallel tail of the smaller 2.5\u201d size since, it is more often fished with heavier weight heads and doesn\u2019t have the same requirement of incredibly slow swim speeds on the fall as the 2.5\u201d.\u00a0 As larger sized baits tend to be used in deeper water or dirtier water chasing more estuarine sportfish species, the rolled over tail design of the 4\u201d Grub creates more disturbance in the water, allowing predators to key in on the bait even when the water is not clear.\nA rigging line is prominent on both the top and bottom sides of the body for those who prefer a tail up or down rigging method. The BaitJunkie 4\u201d Grub is an ideal choice for shallow water snapper, estuarine flathead and many more species throughout Australia. \nFeatures:\n\nAmino X-Natural Flavor and Scent.\nElastomax Material-Incredible Stretch and Durability.\nFloating Material\nThe BaitJunkie 4\u201d Grub comes in 5 pieces per pack.\n\nSpecifications:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLength (mm/inch)\nType\n\nQty/pk\n\n\n\n88/4\nGrub\n5pcs\n\n\n",

It can also be used in open water when a \"gliding\" action may be better suited. It allows a slower presentation.\nIt has a wider tail to give it balance and buoyancy as you work it slowly through the shallows. The Vudu Weedless comes with a belly style hook configuration which makes it much more weedless than our traditional Vudu Shrimp.

This bait is also ideally suited for rigging on the EZ KeeperZ Weighted Hooks or similar swimbait hooks for shallow flats, where the naturally buoyancy of the ElaZtech material allows it to float off the bottom at a perfectly natural angle to trigger strikes from redfish, seatrout, and flounder alike!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFEATURES\n\n\n\n\nThe Z-Man Trout Trick Jerk ShrimpZ mimic the jet-propulsion swimming motion of fleeing shrimp.\n\n\nTail-first design for backward frantic swimming action.\n\n\nAppendages, twin-paddle antennae, and tucked-under tail for amazing action.\n\n\nIdeal for targeting sea trout, redfish, snook, flounder, and small tarpon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The 5\" Jerk ShadZ is ideal for popular inshore targets like redfish, seatrout, flounder, and snook, while freshwater bass anglers have found it to be effective as both a surface twitch bait for largemouth and a drop-shot bait for outsized smallmouth. An upsized version of its 5\" little brother, the 7\" Jerk ShadZ is a deadly search and reaction bait for stripers, bull reds, snook, tarpon, cobia, pike, and musky. Both size Jerk ShadZ is also incredibly effective when pinned to a heavy jighead and jigged vertically for grouper, snapper, amberjack, and yellowtail, where they not only trigger violent strikes but also hold up to constant abuse from bait-stealers like no other scented soft plastics on the market!\n\n\u00a0\nFEATURES \n\n\n10X Tough ElaZtech\u00ae construction for extreme durability, even in the harshest saltwater environments\n\n\nSalt-impregnated, split-tail jerk shad body with hook slot for weedless rigging and solid hooksets\n\n\nImpregnated with 100% natural Pro-Cure Mullet Super Gel Scent\n\n\n4\" size comes 5 baits per pack\n\n\n5\" size comes 5 baits per pack\n\n\n7\" size comes 4 baits per pack\n\n\nMade in the USA\n\n\n",

Its design is aerodynamic making long cast (even against strong upwind) simple. The hooks are sharp which makes for easy hook set and has an excellent action that draws instance strikes from snakeheads. If you are into snakehead fishing, this is a must-have-beginner-friendly frog. Works best for C. striata (country snakehead, larger snakehead species like the C. diplograma will damage this lure).\nTip for beginners: Use darker colors when fishing in muddy water or heavy cover.",

Built with a new injection process each Bobby\u2019s Perfect Frog is made with a consistent shape and super soft hollow body, so they collapse easily to expose the razor-sharp hooks.

Taking its performance a leap further, an innovative water evacuation system naturally expels any water infiltration during a cast for unbeatable buoyancy and consistent performance. Boasting custom paint schemes designed and created by award-winning lure designer Andrew Gardner, the Snag Proof Bobby's Perfect Frog delivers unbelievably good looks that equally match its peerless performance.\nSpecification:\n\n\n\nSize\nWeight\n\n\n\n80mm\n\n18g\n\n\n\n\n",

After being crafted from 100s of hours of on-the-water product testing and refinement, this all-new, ultra-long casting Launch Frog is every fisherman's prayer as it comes with the new pinnacle of technical design and gives a splendid performance in a top water frog.\u00a0\nThe secret of Launch Frog\u2019s performance is it's unique tungsten \u201cparasite\u201d weight system adding weight without bulk to the hook shank. So, to fish or not to fish? What a stupid question.\nCompared to other baits, this bait gives you maximum distance in a top water frog while premium Owner hooks and high compression body deliver the highest hook-up rate possible in a hollow body frog and also delivers a super-soft high compression wide body design wrapped around a premium 5/0 Owner RED double frog hook basically for maximum water displacement and buoyancy. Oh yes, we're gonna need a bigger boat!Taking advantage of the famous Scum Frog brass button rear-weight this bait maintains a nose-up frog profile critical to frog performance. Every Launch Frog is finished in a 40-strand premium silicone skirt. So be ready to bait the bigger fish.\n\n\nFeatures:\n\nManufactured at American Baitworks in Mississippi, USA\nHeaviest frog in the Scum Frog line up (weighs in between 5/8oz and 3/4oz)\nLarger body for increased buoyancy\u00a0\nBrass button-style tail weight\nInternal tungsten weight system\nPremium 5/0 Owner \u201cRED\u201d double frog hook\n40 strand premium silicone skirt\u00a0\nComes in eight digitally printed realistic colors\nMade of domestic and imported contents\nThe Product length is excluding the skirt\n\nAbout the Parasite Tungsten Weight System:\nScum Frog\u2019s proprietary weight system was developed specifically for the company\u2019s Launch Frog. The parasite system is a tungsten weight with integrated locking tabs that enables the weight to be attached securely onto the shank of the Owner hook to ensure proper weight distribution and consistent performance with every frog we build in our Mississippi-based manufacturing facility.\n\n\n",

            "description": "Scum Frog Trophy Series | 15g | 1pcs/pkt\nWell, they say the most ideal route to an angler's heart is through his bait. So you'd rather be fishing with this bait. With this fresh new look, the Scum Frog Trophy Series Painted Frog is now available in highly realistic colors which are meticulously designed by award-winning, internationally renowned lure artist Andrew Gardner. Made with a proprietary manufacturing process, each Scum Frog Trophy Series Painted Frog features a digitally patterned color on the outside, with an extremely durable finish that won\u2019t wear off after multiple aggressive fish catches.\nSpecially made for working the edges of vegetation, the Scum Frog Trophy Series Painted Frog is designed to ride low and push a lot of water for more surface disturbance to trigger aggressive blow-ups. It's ultra-soft plastic body also walks the dog with ease and instantly collapses providing it with an excellent hookup ratio. On the rear, it is equipped with a patented keel hole that allows the frog to self-drain at the beginning of every cast to ensure a proper presentation. Armed with an Owner hook that delivers lightning-fast hook sets, the Scum Frog Trophy Series Painted Frog gives frog fishing a new level of detail.\nFeatures:\n\nBig, pre-weighted bait for big fish\nSits higher in the water than standard frogs\nLong, supple filament legs deliver erratic kicking action\nLarge, easily-seen 3/8\" reflective eyes\nUltrasharp, well-hidden Owner hooks.\n\n",

Leopard frogs are named so for the array of irregularly shaped dark spots that adorn their backs and legs. They are greenish-brown in color with a pearly white underside and light-colored ridges on either side of their backs. Leopard frogs generally live near ponds and marshes, but will often venture into well-covered grasslands as well, earning them their other common name, the meadow frog. Leopard frogs will eat just about anything they can fit in their mouths. They sit still and wait for prey to come by, then pounce with their powerful legs. They eat beetles, ants, flies, worms, smaller frogs, including their own species, and even birds, and garter snakes. Leopard Frog lures are designed to create a subtle popping sound and on the steady speed retrieve it will splash and pushes water on the surface.

            "description": "The Goodmeal Spin Blade +\u00a0is a small tail spin that can be used with any type of fish and in any location\u00a0. It has an additional blade, making it the Goodmeal Spin Blade+. The target fish are the same as before, small migratory fish such as mackerel, horse mackerel, and barracuda at sea fishing parks and embankments, and black porgy and sea bass (seigo size) in rivers, but the additional blade makes it possible to generate stronger flashing (reflection) and vibration (water movement).\nDespite its small body, it has a strong appeal and can attract fish from a wider range. It is also effective in situations where it is difficult for fish to notice you, such as during dim light or when the water is murky. Although it has more parts, there are very few problems, so you can enjoy fishing comfortably.\nThe basic usage is simple, just wind it in. The two blades attached to the tail and hook rotate to appeal to fish. Available in 5g and 7g sizes, the trick to increasing your catch is to use the right one depending on the water depth and the layer where the fish are swimming. It also supports lift and fall, which moves the rod up and down. This action is effective for rockfish and rockfish that hide near walls such as embankments and around tetrapods.Aim for more catches with the Good Meal Spin Blade+, which has big power in its small body!\n\n\n\n\n",

This characteristic makes the lure extremely versatile both for inshore and offshore fishing.The oscillation while the bait is sinking, combined with the pauses during the retrieval, triggers the attack of the predators. The particular groove of the snout, in the front part of the bait improves its movement both with a linear retrieval and with strong jerks.The body made of ABS is very resistant.

            "description": "\n\n\nBonnie Blade is a new series of Lucky John spinners. These lures combine modern design solutions that ensure reliable and stable playing of spinners and, most importantly, make them very attractive for any predatory fish. A spinning blade is the main element of the spinners. It is lightweight, is made of brass, and has good dynamic properties when spinning in the water, thus it allows performing reeling of the lure at minimum speed. The blade is wound up as soon as the spinner starts to move. The blades are painted from both sides. No matter from which side the fish is looking, the blade\u2019s color will remain the same and attractive, which increases the interest of the fish in the lure and, as a result, ends up in an effective attack. Another important element is a mandrel, which influences the weight and casting range of the lure, as well as its stability in the water. Two types of mandrels are used in Bonnie Blade spinners: balls and cylindrical. Thanks to the main ball, the center of gravity of the spinner are shifted to its tail end, thus increasing the casting range of its smaller models. A cylindrical mandrel of larger models is made of brass with crosswise grooves, which, undoubtedly, increase the lure\u2019s attractiveness, as well as stabilize its horizontal position when moving in the water. Metal ball-bearings and a reflective cone are intended for easy spinning of the blade around its axis and prevent its \u201csticking\u201d. Rigid fixing wire of the blade, which is made of steel unriveted wire drilled from the sides, ensures complete freedom of spinning of the blade with minimum friction with the axis of the lure. All the trebles have a bright fly, the main function of which is to take away all the doubts from the predatory fish ready to attack. Moreover, the fly plays the role of a stabilizer of horizontal stability. The base of the spinner is stainless carbon wire. Its axis will not deform in extreme situations, and the lure will always be in operable condition.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifications: \n\n\n\n\n\n\nModel No.\n\nSize\nWeight\n\n\n\nLJBB00\n#0\n2.7g\n\n\nLJBB01\n#1\n3.5g\n\n\nLJBB02\n#2\n4.3g\n\n\n\nLJBB04\n\n\n#4\n\n10.3g\n\n\nLJBB05\n#5\n13.4g\n\n\n",

For maximum movement, the hook on the Freedom Live Action Spinnerbait is attached using their advanced interchangeable hook design which gives trailers a natural swimming presentation.\nIn addition, this hook release system allows for quick and easy replacement, so anglers can pre-rig a variety of trailers and switch them out without ever having to retie. Also, the revolutionary design keeps fish from using the lure as leverage to spit the hook, resulting in more landed fish.\nFrom end-to-end, the Freedom Live Action Spinnerbait features premium components, including a super bright Willow/Colorado blade combo, top-of-the-line swivel, and a spring lock trailer keeper. Finished with a hardened epoxy finish for long-lasting durability, the Freedom Live Action Spinnerbait delivers a bright, highly attractive presentation that will help trigger strikes from otherwise uninspired fish.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n\n\n\nWeight\nColor\nQty/pk\n\n\n21g\nBlue Shad\n1\n\n\n\n",

This casting jig catches a large variety of fish from the top of the water column to the bottom by changing your retrieve speed.\nWhen reeled in, the jig\u2019s Kick Tail moves naturally to attract fish as the body design displaces water. On the fall, it creates life-like wobbling action and ultimately shakes the rubber skirted tail as well. The jigs body has a distinct flashing appeal and its natural action will trigger many species of fish to strike. One of the most effective techniques is to lift and drop the jig slowly and continuously around the bottom, especially when targeting fluke or rockfish.\nTargeted fish: Tune, Yellowtail, Dolphin, Red Snapper, Grouper, Mackerel, Fluke, Flounder, Rockfish, etc.",

The large size of the leaf makes the loot looks bigger and more attractive to the fish. From technical point of view, the vibration signals shift to lower frequency levels. This combination of perceptions led to adapt the speed of the harvest to obtain low frequency signals that cause the attack of the predator. AGLIA No 7 takes under consideration this phenomenon. It attracts larger fish which normally remains reluctant to chasing smaller fish which is difficult to catch due to its quick motion.

The two blades in harmony amplify the vibrations without disturbing the conformity of the frequencies emitted; increase the optical signals without making them excessive: optimize the \"target\" signal and the \"Flexible Tandem\" action demonstrates new and recognizable advantages.

This is because the Mepps Musky Killer has caught more record musky than any other musky bucktail.\nSunny fall days will provide calm afternoon water, and are excellent times to fish a Musky Killer in the cabbage weeds. It\u2019s here the muskys go to warm themselves. They also take advantage of the shadows to stalk their prey. Because of the similarity of weather conditions, this is also an excellent place to find muskys in the early summer.\nMusky season opens early on many shallow northern musky lakes, and fishing these cold waters can be the key to early season action. A slow presentation is needed, and the Musky Killer's blade, like the blade on all Mepps spinners, begins spinning at even the slowest retrieve. Fish shallow bays and large flats of weeds early in the season with a Mepps Musky Killer.\nSpecifications:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nStyle\n\nWeight\n\n\n\n\nDressed (3/4 oz)\n\n\n15g\n\n\n\n",

The result is a sinking lipless minnow with a very high specific weight in relation to the dimensions. This lure is characterized by an excellent castability, typical of a jig and the sinuosity typical of a stick minnow. The small size of this lure faithfully imitates the size of the forage fish, the main prey of the coastal and offshore predators. This characteristic makes the lure extremely versatile both for inshore and offshore fishing. The oscillation while the bait is sinking, combined with the pauses during the retrieval, triggers the attack of the predators. The particular groove of the snout, in the front part of the bait improves its movement both with a linear retrieval and with strong jerks. The body made of ABS is very resistant. The 3D technology and the UV coating make the colors more brilliant, durable and improves the appearance.\nFeatures: \n\n\n3D Textured Details\nHydrodinamic Profile\nUV Coating\nHi-Grade ABS Body\nRod Suggested: 6.6\" to 9.0\" Regular Fast Action\nP.E Line 1.2 to 2.5\nLeader Line: Fluorocarbon or Nylon 12-30lb\nDesigned and Engineering by Molix in Italy.\n\nSpecifications:\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nModel No.\n\nLength\n\nWeight\n\n\n\nCJM85B\n\n\n8.5cm | 3.3/8inch\n\n26g | 7/8oz\n\n\n\n",

            "description": "ChatterBait JackHammer StealthBlade\u00a0 | 1/2 OZ \n\nDESCRIPTIONA valuable combination of refined energy, unpredictable action and visual stealth, the new Z-Man JackHammer StealthBlade adds an exciting new chapter to the book of the bladed jig. The driving force behind the patented new ChatterBait design, a clear polycarbonate blade produces a totally different sound and vibration, but like its predecessor, starts thumping intensely with the first half-turn of the reel handle. The blade's specialized oval split-ring line tie increases stealth, and offers less surface area and no protrusions to catch vegetation or other snags. Armed with a lighter wire, custom Decoy\u00ae fluorine nanocoated hook, the StealthBlade can be cast on slightly lighter line and penetrates the jaws of bass with less hook-setting effort. To preserve the StealthBlade's high-level, ultra-durable JackHammer heritage and performance, silicone skirts are hand-tied with stainless steel wire. Dual wire trailer keepers pin soft plastic trailers in place for the long haul. The StealthBlade's low center of gravity, fish-shaped head tracks true and skips easily. When the situation suggests a bladed jig, but instinct advises finesse, the ChatterBait JackHammer StealthBlade becomes the smartest play of the day.

A single strand of GORE Performance Fiber is surrounded by 12 precision braided HMPE fibers. It has been constructed in such a way that it has no weak points which leads to strength consistency.\nIt is said that the GORE\u00ae Performance Fiber is the most abrasion resistant textile fiber as it is solid and round like a monofilament but has the same low stretch as the PE fibers so yes there's no more problems with gliding or knots opening! In addition, the 13-carrier construction increases the number of fibers at the knot resulting in better knot tying and stronger holding power.\nIt has a structure in which the Sufix 131 G-Core is much rounder than any other competitor\u2019s 12 or 16 carrier braid. The rounder line reduces the resistance in water (while retrieving) and the abrasion caused by rod guides and obstacles in the water. The line can be\u00a0prevented from internal fraying with the core fiber (GORE Performance Fiber) thus making the line more durable.\nA rounder line casts farther, is more silent and is more accurate. The cancelled center hole does not allow water to enter \u2013 no water means lighter line and longer casting distances.\nThis Sufix 131 G-Core braided line is great for casting and jigging, when you need a relatively thin line. This Sufix 131 G-Core can be recommended for example for light-tackle salt water fishing and European predator fishing.\n\u00a0\nSpecifications:\u00a0\n\n\n\n\nLength\n\n300M\n300M\n300M\n\n\nWeight\n\n28lb/ 12.70Kg\n30lb/ 13.6Kg\n35lb/ 15.88Kg\n\n\nDiameter\n\n0.205mm\n0.235mm\n0.285mm\n\n\n",

This results in a smoother finish and reduced diameter, which aids in all aspects of casting and jigging across PE 0.8 to PE 8.0.\n\nSpecifications:\n\n\n\n\n\nDiameter\nWeight (lb)\nWeight (kg)\n\n\n0.10 mm\n16.8 lb\n7.6 kg\n\n\n0.13 mm\n20.1 lb\n9.1 kg\n\n\n0.19 mm\n30.0 lb\n\n13.6 kg\n\n\n\n0.20 mm\n38.6 lb\n\n17.5 kg\n\n\n\n0.23 mm\n59.5 lb\n\n27.0 kg\n\n\n\n0.28 mm\n73.6 lb\n\n33.4 kg\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nMade in Japan",

            "description": "Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip\nClips have a pretty mixed reputation. Many anglers absolutely swear by them. Others are more cautious, preferring a more pragmatic approach to lure and rig connections. Most anglers will have a story of how a clip has inexplicably uncoupled from the rig or lure, resulting in the loss of the best fish ever. Mustad continually refines terminal tackle design with the sole purpose of ensuring you catch more fish. The Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip is the latest innovation in fishing clips and is proving to be a revelation. The first feature is the ease at which lures and rigs can be changed. It\u2019s a very fast process. The speed of a lure change is often critical, particularly when you are going through your lure arsenal, trying to see which lure the fish you are casting at will respond to. Without a method for a quick change, the fish will often move on before you have tied the knot on your second lure. The Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip is the ultimate connection. There is no way the lure can become disconnected. Even if the clip is taking mouth pressure from the fish, there is no \u2018latching\u2019 system that can come undone via pressure. The Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip for sale now is available. If your budget can afford it we suggest Grabbing a couple of test weights, test the veracity of the lofty claims, and never lose a fish to clip failure or slow lure change again. Features And Specifications\n\nStainless Steel construction\n\n\nIdeal for a quick change on most lures or tackle\n\n\nMustad Fastach Clip System\n\n\nThe model we sell is snap only (swivel not included)\n\n\n\n\nSize\nQuantity/pack\nWeight\n\n\n1 (1.5cm)\n12\n25lb/14kg\n\n\n2 (1.8cm)\n12\n50lb/28kg\n\n\n3 (2.3cm)\n12\n75lb/41kg\n\n\n\u00a04\n\n10\n100lb/55kg\n\n\n5\n8\n150lb/83kg\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBenefits\n\nAllows for super-fast lure and rig changes.\n\n\nStainless construction ensures long working life.\n\n\nLure or rig is completely secure.

            "description": "Despite the proliferation of lures for every circumstance, particularly trolling for mega fish, the live baitfish or dead fish baits are still as popular as ever for all our favorite pelagics. While rigging or \u2018baiting-up\u2019 for this style of fishing is highly demanding, the process is made quicker and easier if you use quality tools.\nThe Surecatch live bait needle is ideally suited for tying bridle rigs. The bridle rig is preferred offshore for a number of reasons. Firstly, trolling a baitfish for maximum performance requires rigging the fish to swim forwards as naturally as possible; The bridle rig delivers.\nSecondly, the bridle rig is well suited for running \u2019J\u2019 and circle hooks, with the latter becoming the hook of choice for so many offshore flesh bait applications and game fishing tournaments.\nA strong and reliable rig can be the difference between tagging your target and not getting a touch. Using the right tools, and attention to detail, can make the difference between achieving a reliable rig and a second-rate bait-up.\nWhile tying a reliable rig and achieving peak action from our bait are the goals, we also want to be able to complete our rigs quickly. A bait that\u2019s not in the water will never catch a fish.\nSurecatch Bait needles come in a packet of 5. They\u2019re 1mm thick and 130mm long. The eyes are easy to thread without being so big as to compromise the rig by putting big holes in your bait. The live bait needle is an essential kit for the pro angler and blue water regular. Grab a pack so you\u2019re never without a sharp one.\nFEATURES AND SPECIFICATIONS\n\n5 x 180mm Bait Needles per Pack\n180mm / 7 inches Long\n0.7mm Diameter\n\nBENEFITS\n\nIdeal for bridle rigging small to medium-sized baits.\nPerfect for rigging Slimy, Yakka, Skipjacks, Big Squid, and other baitfish.\nGenerous pack size delivers value for money.\nSmall diameter and small eyes deliver a more secure rig due to the smaller holes in your bait.\n\nSurecatch bait needles should be your first choice for rigging live and dead fish baits. The handy five-pack and thoughtful needle design ensure value for money and reliable performance. Grab a bunch of packs so you\u2019re never caught without a Surecatch live bait needle.",

            "description": "Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip\nClips have a pretty mixed reputation. Many anglers absolutely swear by them. Others are more cautious, preferring a more pragmatic approach to lure and rig connections. Most anglers will have a story of how a clip has inexplicably uncoupled from the rig or lure, resulting in the loss of the best fish ever. Mustad continually refines terminal tackle design with the sole purpose of ensuring you catch more fish. The Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip is the latest innovation in fishing clips and is proving to be a revelation. The first feature is the ease at which lures and rigs can be changed. It\u2019s a very fast process. The speed of a lure change is often critical, particularly when you are going through your lure arsenal, trying to see which lure the fish you are casting at will respond to. Without a method for a quick change, the fish will often move on before you have tied the knot on your second lure. The Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip is the ultimate connection. There is no way the lure can become disconnected. Even if the clip is taking mouth pressure from the fish, there is no \u2018latching\u2019 system that can come undone via pressure. The Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip for sale now is available. If your budget can afford it we suggest Grabbing a couple of test weights, test the veracity of the lofty claims, and never lose a fish to clip failure or slow lure change again. Features And Specifications\n\nStainless Steel construction\n\n\nIdeal for a quick change on most lures or tackle\n\n\nMustad Fastach Clip System\n\n\nThe model we sell is snap only (swivel not included)\n\n\n\n\nSize\nQuantity/pack\nWeight\n\n\n1 (1.5cm)\n12\n25lb/14kg\n\n\n2 (1.8cm)\n12\n50lb/28kg\n\n\n3 (2.3cm)\n12\n75lb/41kg\n\n\n\u00a04\n\n10\n100lb/55kg\n\n\n5\n8\n150lb/83kg\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\nBenefits\n\nAllows for super-fast lure and rig changes.\n\n\nStainless construction ensures long working life.\n\n\nLure or rig is completely secure.

            "description": "\nSelf-cocking Crossbow Pistol Cross 80 Lbs\nThis 80 lb draw weight crossbow uses an easy and safe-to-use cocking mechanism. Manufactured with a strong plastic body and compressed molded fiberglass bow, this crossbow pistol is very durable and perfect for target practice. With a firing speed of 165 fps, the 80 lb crossbow is great for small games. The new self-cocking mechanism is much more safe and far less strenuous to use. By simply pulling down on a pivoting arm lever, this crossbow's cable is cocked much more easily, even engaging the safety automatically. The speediness of the new cocking mechanism shortens reload time, allowing you to get off more shots quickly. Like all weapons and gear, proper maintenance is essential in prolonging the life of your crossbow. With each use, elements of the crossbow can begin to wear. We also recommend applying rail lube often to your crossbow's rail slide and wax to your string to decrease the friction that can hurt your string. It's also recommended to check the tightness of your crossbow's screws often as vibration can loosen them over time.\n\n\n\nLaunches bolts more than 100 yards\nFiber-graphite limbs; die-cast alloy/solid brass body\nSighting, windage, elevation wheels click-tune for accuracy\nMeasures approximately 18\" x 6\"\nIncludes three 6\" aluminum arrows\nAutomatic safety\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: There is no cash-on-delivery option available for Crossbow.\n",

Made of mild steel and protected with a porcelain-enamel coating, our grills provide you with the best in terms of quality, aesthetics, and sturdiness.\nProduct Size:\u00a058 x 50 x 79cmFire Bowl:\u00a045.8cm x 0.8mmCooking Height:\u00a058.5cmCooking Grid:\u00a044cmCharcoal Grid:\u00a035.5cmLid:\u00a047.5 x 10.8cm x 0.4mmLeg:\u00a02.2cm x 0.5mm\n\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAluminum Damper\n\nThe grill features an aluminum intake damper that provides rust resistance and an easy intake of oxygen to keep your barbecue alive and burning. The damper sits on a dome-shaped lid that circulates the air perfectly for smoking.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsh Catcher\n\nA removable ash catcher made of galvanized steel sits right below the charcoal bowl and catches any ash that falls out, avoiding any sort of a mess on your floor and makes for an easy clean-up.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCooking Grate\n\nThe removable steel plated cooking grate provides a durable and sturdy cooking area of 1520 sq cm, that is not only large enough for all your barbecue needs, but also quite easy to clean.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBowl and Charcoal Grate\n\nThe bowl itself is protected with a porcelain-enamel coating, making it heat resistant and waterproof, allowing you to clean the bowl post use with minimum effort. A second steel plated grate at the bottom of the bowl provides an elevated platform to place your charcoal on. Not only does this help in keeping your charcoal separate from ash, but also allows for even burning due to the additional circulation it provides.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHandle and Wheels\n\nMild steel handles on either side of the bowl, combined with all-weather wheels attached to stainless steel legs, make the Roundhouse Tripod easy to move around and able to withstand all outdoor conditions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Manufacturer\n\nOur grills are made of quality materials and incorporate a bunch of features keeping in mind the requirements of your inner chef.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0",
