EXCELER LT



The new Exceler LT gets a radical makeover: the structure has been redesigned to improve both performance and reliability.













The latest generation of the EXCELER LT reel gets a radical makeover: the structure has been redesigned to improve both performance and reliability. Both body and rotor are still made of Daiwa’s exclusive carbon composite, ZAION V, but completely redesigned to offer even more lightness, smoothness and strength.
The rotor is now of the AIRDRIVE type: thanks to a reduction in the weight of the rotating masses and a spherically inspired aerodynamic design, the new Exceler allows for superior feel and sensitivity during retrieval due to reduced inertia.
The new AIRDRIVE solid bow has a conformation designed to prevent tangles even when the line has low tension. It is also lighter but at the same time more durable than the older generation.
The new ATD-L clutch makes retrieval even safer: the increased progressiveness reduces the risk of dislodging and helps you better handle thin wires.

Fishing,Spinning Reels,Daiwa BG MQ 8000H- 14000H Spinning Reels,16767.0,41933691224182,"Daiwa BG MQ 8000 -14000H Spinning Reels
Description:
Daiwa’s BG series has changed the game of what affordable quality looks like in heavy-duty spinning reels. Now, by combining Monocoque Body (MQ) technology with the mass market appeal of BG, 20 BG MQ is born.
Monocoque Body (MQ) is the single biggest revolution in spinning reel design from Daiwa by totally eliminating the traditional two-piece body construction. MQ reels don’t use any side plates and feature a completely screwless body design which eliminates potential entry points for water &amp; grime, and significantly enhances overall body strength and rigidity. 
The screwless design principle of MQ bodies are also significantly more compact than a standard body design. Screws need material to grip to, and that means more overall size and more mass in traditional body designs. By replacing the side plate with a machined aluminium engine plate which screws directly into the reel body, MQ reels can maximise the internal space made available by using larger size drive gears than before.
Throughout the entire line-up of BG MQ, vast improvements have been made to almost all areas of the reel design. The drag has been improved both in maximum capacity but also in smooth overall performance, drastically reducing the friction of the Carbon ATD drag - BG MQ’s drag performance is unmatched by the competition.
The MQ body construction not only has the obvious benefits of a stronger &amp; more compact body design, it also delivers an increase in gear durability thanks to absolute zero movement of drivetrain components once installed inside an MQ body. Weather-sealing is also significantly improved, with seals visible in multiple locations throughout the reel, BG MQ is built for the harshest of environments.
Casting performance has also been improved with the implementation of Long Cast ABS (LC-ABS) spool design. LC-ABS spool design improves line flow from the spool, resulting in increased casting distances across the board with both heavy &amp; light lines.
Throughout the BG MQ range, improvements have been made specific to the size of each reel to maximise their performance and overall appeal to each target market.
Small size BG MQ (2500-4000) feature dramatically larger sized drive gears. Middle sized models 5000 &amp; 6000 now feature the Rigid Air Rotor design, maximising strength and appeal for mid-weight sportfishing applications. Larger size BG MQ from 8000-20000 receive huge benefits as a result of the MQ body, with the leg &amp; main body drastically increased in strength without increasing weight.
BG MQ marks a new era in affordable saltwater spinning reels from Daiwa, with MQ technology now available to the masses. BG MQ is built for the harshest conditions and is set to once again revolutionise the industry. Available from 2500-20000 size, BG MQ is now aligned with 20 SALTIGA sizing.
Features:


ABS LONGCAST
Compared to conventional spools, the LC-ABS has been shown to increase the average flight distance by approx. 5% due to its reduced weight and modified shape.


ATD DRAG
Daiwa's Automatic Tournament Drag uses an improved drag grease that exhibits a low viscosity at rest, yet becomes more viscous immediately after drag start up. This reduces initial drag start-up inertia and combined with the structural changes of the ATD Drag System results in a smoother drag from the initial hook up.


METAL ALLOY BODY
Rock solid in strength and performance, alloy is tailor made for Australian conditions and allows a reel to be created that is light, yet strong, and supremely rigid and highly corrosion resistant.


MONOCOQUE (MQ)
A one-piece frame eliminates the use of traditional two-piece body &amp; sideplate construction. A single piece body utilises a screw-in engine plate to house the main gear, reducing flex and twist under load creating a sealed mechanism. The elimination of the side plate also has also allowed for a more compact body design. MQ technology not only makes reels stronger &amp; better sealed, but also more compact.

Super practical model with further improved performance


STRADIC SW has been attacking the harsh sea fishing scene with its power, toughness, and waterproof performance that are comparable to those of higher-end models. Such a super practical reel has finally been renewed with the evolution of the right reel in the right place by product number. No.4000 is based on the acclaimed 23 STRADIC, introducing INFINITYXROSS, INFINITYDRIVE, and ANTITWISTFIN to pursues further comfort of use such as improved gear durability and suppression of line trouble. Each model from No.5000 to No.10,000 is equipped with X TOUGH DRAG, which achieves improved specifications in terms of durability, heat dissipation, and maximum drag force. The specifications are designed for fighting with heavy weight lures and large fish. In addition, the No.5000 and No.6000 eliminate the conventional bail auto-return mechanism to shut out trouble in casting. A total of nine items have been narrowed down to construct a series more suited to practical use along with performance that surpasses its class.

Fishing,Spinning Reels,Daiwa SALTIST MQ 6000D-H || MQ 8000-H  Spinning Reel,28685.0,40368716611702,"
It is introducing the new Saltist MQ reel, equipped with a single-piece aluminum Monocoque body designed to withstand the tough conditions of Australian saltwater fishing and the hardy fish in these waters. One of Daiwa's most renowned features, Magseal, combines with the MQ body to create a reel that is well-protected from the harsh marine environment. The larger diameter Tough Digigear, housed in the single piece Monocoque body, transfers power delivered through the handle to your line, enabling you to stop even the strongest fish in their tracks. 
In addition, Saltist MQ features a tubular hollow Air Bail, which enhances line management and improves line flow back into the line roller, providing unmatched performance even in windy conditions with the lightest braids. With a comprehensive size range from 2500 up to 20000, there is a Saltist MQ reel suitable for every fishing location in the country. Whether you're casting lures or dropping baits for reef species and pelagics, or fishing in coastal estuaries and rivers, Saltist MQ has got you covered. 
All Saltist MQ models now come with the Aluminium Round Knob, providing superior grip and stability. If you're in the market for a new saltwater spinning reel that can handle the toughest conditions, look no further than the brand-new Saltist MQ.
Product Features: 
Monocoque (MQ) – One Piece Body
MQ Body takes reel design to the next level. The MQ system does not require conventional side plate, instead using an engine plate to screw directly to the body. Eliminating the need for screws to hold a body cover in place. MQ body improves the strength of the reel, it also improves the water resistance of the body and allows a larger diameter drive gear to be installed.
ABS-Longcast – Long Cast Spool Technology
Compared to conventional spools, the LC-ABS has been shown to increase the average flight distance by approx. 5% due to its reduced weight and modified shape.
Air-Bail
Daiwa’s innovative bail design features a hollow tubular stainless steel bail that delivers maximum rigidity and strength with minimum weight. Featuring a smooth protrusion-free design and construction line easily slides unencumbered along the Air Bail towards the line roller for trouble-free line control.
Air-Rotor – Lightweight Rotor
Lighter, stronger, and more balanced than any rotor system that’s come before, ‘Air Rotor’ delivers a great leap forward in rotor design and function and delivers the ultimate line roller support. Made from Zaion and featuring a redesigned arch that disperses pressure to the lower section of the rotor to reduce stressing and flexing, the design is further enhanced with a hollowed-out construction reducing weight, while increasing reel sensitivity and rotational balance.
ATD-Drag – Automatic Tournament Drag
Daiwa’s Automatic Tournament Drag uses an improved drag grease that exhibits a low viscosity at rest, yet becomes more viscous immediately after drag start-up. This reduces initial drag start-up inertia and combined with the structural changes of the ATD Drag System results in a smoother drag from the initial hook-up.
Machine Cut Handle
Our new handle design is slimmer, more compact, and 50% lighter. 
Infinite Anti Reverse
Daiwa's advanced system that limits rearward back play handle movement to almost zero for solid hooksets with less shock to the reel. The result is the elimination of handle slap-back and the unwanted release of line.
Magsealed-Body
Ultimate protection is delivered to the engine room of the reel with a magnetised oil seal located on the main shaft of the reel’s rotor shutting the door to the elements and unwanted intruders. Dust, water, and salt intrusion into the inner workings of a reel are a thing of the past with MagSeal.
Metal Ball Knob
Providing maximum contact between the handle knob and the hand, ball knobs are designed for optimal rotation balance, rotation, and functionality.
Metal Alloy Body
Rock solid in strength and performance, the alloy is tailor made for Australian conditions and allows a reel to be created that is light, yet strong, supremely rigid and highly corrosion resistant.
Perfect Line Stopper – Improved Line Clip Design
Our new larger rectangular flexible clip can be used from all line angles and from light to heavy lines.

Attributes include an anti-reverse facility, lightweight CI4+ body and rotor, and advanced HAGANE gearing for peerless performance. If you are a competition angler, or fish using a float or feeder, and want a reel to match your ability, the Aero XR is the solution. All of the reels balance perfectly with Shimano’s best Aero X5, X7 and Pro match and feeder rods, giving you an enviable combination that offer a competitive advantage. With their super smooth waterproof drags, and an additional anti-reverse facility, you can play fish directly off the drag when using stronger lines, by back-winding when using fine lines, or by using a combination of both. 
 The larger 5000 model has an additional reducer for use with braid when feeder fishing at long range. Power is delivered by a very direct screw in handle and a metal line clip, that is strong and line-safe, reinforces the XR’s feeder fishing pedigree.Visually, the understated ‘stealth-like’ looks of the Aero XR are stunning and combined with the advanced engineering technology can’t fail to inspire your confidence to perform at the highest level.


HAGANE GEAR

With amazing strength and durability, the HAGANE Gear is at the very heart of most Shimano reels. Shimano, through the application of state-of-the-art technologies, gives anglers the long-lasting smoothness and enjoyment that is felt when anglers first use a reel, over and over again. No cutting work is applied to the teeth of the drive gear during fabrication; instead, the entire surface is calculated in minute detail by a special 3D design and then formed by Shimano's cold-forging technology. The result is assured resilience. HAGANE Gear is the result of Shimano's endless pursuit for durability — this strength and power of forged metal continue to represent the fundamental concept of Shimano reels.





X SHIP

X SHIP provides improved gear performance. Large diameter drive gear, optimally positioned pinion gear and drive gear, and two points bearings supported pinion gear produce light reeling under load.

Cyclonic Flow Rotor
Create “cyclonic” airflow, which significantly increases air around the rotor and allows for a much faster drying time if the reel becomes wet, minimizing corrosion possibilities throughout the reel.


  

Quick-Set Anti-Reverse
Engage the reel in one direction for rock-solid hook sets.


  

Precision Elliptical Gearing System
Creates less friction during casting for increased distance, greater accuracy, and longer line life, as well as smoother, much uniform drag pressures.


  

Rotor Equalizing System

Centrifugal Disc Bail (CDB)
The Centrifugal Disc Bail (CDB) design incorporates a heavier brass disc that is perfectly weighted and balanced to create smoother bail operations. CDB increases the strength and stability of bail functions.




Progressive Drag
Okuma’s 1-K woven carbon fiber drag knob is light weight and creates progressive drag settings. Our progressive drag allows you to customize settings to specific conditions and fish or adjust your drag during a long fight.




C-40X
Okuma’s C-40X long strand carbon fiber technology utilizes a special blended graphite polymer. The carbon fibers in this material are elongated and reinforced, which creates a substantially stronger composite than standard graphite. At 25% lighter, 50% stronger and 100% anti-corrosive, C-40X translates into an extremely lightweight and durably constructed.




Cyclonic Flow Rotor (CFR)
Cyclonic Flow Rotor (CFR) was designed to create “cyclonic” airflow, which significantly increases air around the rotor, beneath and around the spool, with every turn of the handle. This thoroughly tested design allows for a much faster drying time if the reel becomes wet, minimizing corrosion and extending longevity of the reel.




TORSION CONTROL ARMOR® (TCA™)
The one-piece TCA™ design was built using Okuma C-40X carbon fiber technology and made with a double arm design. Compared to traditional single side designs, TCA™’s double arm offers higher torsion and flex resistance under heavy pressure for improved strength. This not only makes the reel lighter but also extremely rigid ensuring the internal parts stays in perfect alignment.

Fishing,Spinning Reels,Shimano CATANA 4000 Spinning Reel,4915.0,39648025870454,"The CATANA FE is the latest version of a Shimano classic. Offering exceptional value for money, the CATANA is a freshwater and inshore saltwater spinning reel that can be used for all kinds of freshwater fishing.
If you are looking for a freshwater spinning reel at a very affordable price, the CATANA FE is one option you should not ignore. 
Ideal for a wide range of fishing, from lightweight and medium-sized lures, to match and feeder fishing, the understated appearance looks fantastic and the performance is remarkable for a reel of this price. Pair the CATANA with any low and mid-priced Shimano rod and you have a great combination that you will be proud to own and use. In use, you’ll immediately notice the improved balance produced by Shimano’s latest G-Free body design. 
This body design is to be found on the very best Shimano reels and makes fishing easier over a long period of time. The smoothness you’ll feel comes from a combination of 3 Shimano Stainless Steel Ball Bearings plus a Roller Bearing, which ensures trouble-free performance, even when playing the largest fish. Like top-of-the-range Shimano reels, the aluminum spool has an AR-C design, which combined with Varispeed II line lay improves casting distance and accuracy, with both mono and braided lines. 
Perhaps the most difficult decision you’ll have to make is which CATANA size to choose. There are 7 models, including fast speed ‘HG’ versions, ranging from the smallest 1000 size suitable for lightweight ‘finesse’ fishing up to the largest 4000 size which is perfect for larger lures and heavy feeder fishing. Whichever you choose, the CATANA is guaranteed to give you many hours of fishing fun and excitement.

Shimano Hyperloop Spinning Reel

The Hyperloop features classical styling along with high-tech features such as Super Stopper and Varispeed line lay. By turning the handle you can immediately appreciate the quality of the gears, and vibration is almost eliminated by Shimano’s Dyna Balance system. The Hyperloop also incorporates a Power Roller that keeps line twist to a minimum. Whereas the smaller models in this series are designed for all types of fishing such as spinning, float, feeder, or any other light to medium-heavy styles, the large 6000 size is an ideal model for heavy-duty spinning, bottom fishing or light surf casting.

The Shimano Hyperloop is a great value reel that will provide long service with minimal issues. Some of the features found on the Shimano Hyperloop 2500 fishing reel are the same features that are found on more expensive Shimano fishing reels.
Having Dyna-Balance, the Hyperloop doesn’t wobble around when winding, and the Aerowave feature ensures that the line lays properly and doesn’t leave the reel in clumps causing line knots.

Fishing,Spinning Reels,Daiwa  Revros EX LT 4000-CXH - Spinning Reel,4915.0,,"
The Daiwa Revros EX LT Spinning Reel is an upgrade of a very popular reel, the Revros, increasing the ball bearing count to 6 from 4 making it smoother.
The Light Composite Housing greatly improves the strength to weight ratio while still providing a solid framework for the powerful gearing.
Another key difference between this Revros is the screw-in handle, offering better performance and shedding a few grams. With an all black finish and a touch of green, this reel looks as good as it performs and at a great price point.

Description :
These reels have become a go to reel for serious saltwater fisho's anglers that prefer a smooth fish catching reel experience.
These reels are popularly preferred by Professional charters and guides as a rugged simple to use reel that works both day in and day out which in the form of hard fighting fish and inexperienced anglers also handles the torture subjected to it making it a proven performer.
Taking two things into account as the necessity of anglers- power and durability, Penn Engineers have designed a frame that is made from a special high-strength alum-alloy to produce a housing that encases rugged gearing system of the Penn Slammer 560.
Realizing that fisho’s would exert larger drag pressures due to the increasing use of braided super lines, the engineers have oversized it's main support shaft for the spool and a triple support system added so that gear alignment and balance would not be compromised even under extreme pressure.
In order to provide more drag area and of course stopping power, the Penn Slammer 560 features a single oversize HT100 drag washer positioned under the spool while also protecting it from the elements.

Description:
The Daiwa Strikeforce B Series Spinning Reel; with hot price and features, it is the most reasonable spinning reel you can buy. Great looking new body design the Strikeforce has twist buster line twist reduction, lightweight and durable ABS aluminum spool, smooth stainless steel ball bearing drive and Digi-Gear digital gear design. The reel comes with a folding handle for compact storage. The ABS spools maximize core diameter and reversed taper means 100% usable line. No dead"" line buried in a deep core. You can fill it with a line right up to the edge of the spool lip without fear of tangles. The spool design provides less casting friction for longer and easier casting. The huge spool diameter lets line flow freely in large coils and produces less line memory coil. Smaller spool diameter means line flows in tighter coils creating casting friction and line memory hurts performance.

Fishing,Spinning Reels,Shimano Nasci Spinning Reel | C3000HG-C5000XG,6913.0,41768007958646,"The Shimano NASCI spinning reel is a high-quality fishing reel at an affordable price point that is suitable for both freshwaters as well as light to medium saltwater fishing applications. In the Shimano NASCI reel review, we will look at how Shimano incorporates their Hagane HGN cold-forged gearing and their X-Ship technology for improved power, durability and functionality. This is a 2021 model reel.
FeaturesOverall, I have to say that I am quite impressed with the quality of this fishing reel at this price point. I have spent hundreds in the past from both Shimano and other manufacturers to get this type of quality. The reel is just silky smooth as I would expect from Shimano, so let’s take a look at all that has been packed into this great reel.
Hagane cold forged gearing – The Hagane precision cold forged gears provide one of the smoothest retrieve experience you will ever have, especially under a heavy load. X-SHIP provides a smoother and stronger precision gear system that places a bearing on the opinion. While this difference does not make itself apparent when you are in the store under no load, the difference does become apparent rather quickly once adequate pressure has been applied (a big fish). The NASCI comes in both a 5.0:1 and 6.2:1 gear ratio.Coreprotect water resistance – Coreprotect provides you with 360-degree all-weather water resistance to make sure that this reel will last a lifetime – if you take care of it.G Free Body – The center of the mass of the reel has been moved closer to the rod to improve the weight and balance in your hand. What this means is that you can feel the strike better and that you can fight the fish better. Additionally, you will not get tired as easily after a long day on the water = no forearm and wrist fatigue. This design was first utilized in the more expensive Shimano Stella and then the Stradic FK reels.X Ship – X-Ship is a combination of features that work together to create much greater efficiency. By positioning the pinion gear close to the center line of the large diameter drive gear, more power is transferred from the handle to the rotor. The pinion gear is also supported by two Shimano A-RB roller bearings. This creates more stability and minimizes pinion gear twist and rotor deflection in extreme situations.Thick Bail Wire – The thick bail wire might not seem like much at first but it does lead to better performance and less chance that the bail will warp over time which then produces sloppier line management and typically leads to wind knots etc. As I have said in the past, make sure that after you cast that you use your hand to close the bail vs snapping it shut with the turn of the handle as this will make your reel last and perform better over time.

Fishing,Spinning Reels,Penn Conflict CFT3000 And CFT4000 Spinning Reel,8658.0,09A535,"Penn Conflict CFT3000 And CFT4000 Spinning Reel
Penn Conflict is moderately weighted and comes with HT-100 drag. It has a metallic body and side plate that allows the angler to maintain a stable gear alignment even when fishing under difficult conditions.The reel comes with a techno-balanced ™ rotor responsible for the reels balanced and smooth retrieve. This is one of the reels in the market with a super line spool ™, and which requires no backing because the rubber gasket does not allow any form of slipping. It is indeed a great reel with a super strong drag that guarantees a great casting distance.
 
FeaturesFull Metal Body – The Penn Conflict models CFT5000, CFT6000 and CFT8000 are the only models that are reported to have a full metal body, however upon inspection of the smaller series reels, I can attest that they all appear to have a full metal body, side plate and rotor just like the Penn Battle II.7+1 Bearing system – This reel incorporates what is referred to as a 7+1 sealed stainless steel ball bearing system as compared to the Battle II that has a 6+1 bearing system. There are 2 on the main gear, 2 on the pinion gear, 2 on the handle knob and one under the main drag on the top of the spool that reduces the friction when the drag is paying out. All bearing is sealed with rubber seals which should hold up well and protect the reel from accidental dunks in the water.Techno-Balanced rotor – The Techno-Balanced rotor is a trademarked rotor design of Penn and is engineered to provide a very smooth retrieve. When combined with the 7+1 bearing system, it makes the reel feel silky smooth.HT-100 carbon fiber drag washers – HT 100 drag system – which utilizes keyed carbon washers in place of the traditional felt washers will lengthen the lifespan of the reel and provide a very smooth non-jerky drag when under load from a retreating fish. By using a keyed washer, there is access to both sides of the washer to provide a smooth drag. The HT stands for the High Tech which is a carbon fiber laminated on fiberglass. The 100 in the name stands for the equivalent of 100 miles of a line being taken from the reel in original testing without any noticeable degradation which is pretty impressive.Infinite Anti-Reverse – The infinite Anti Reverse eliminates the back play on the rotor when you set the hook. This is accomplished by using a one way bearing in the reel design.Heavy-duty aluminum bail wire – The Penn Conflict has an extra heavy duty bail wire that will withstand the test of time and should not warp over a long period of time. This is important as a warped bail will lead to inferior line management.Superline Spool line capacity rings – The super spool incorporates rubber inlayed into the spool which means that you can go direct to the spool with a braid of your choice without having to back it with mono. I really like this feature and we are starting to see it on more and more reels these days. 
This reel also has full line capacity rings which are marked at 1/3 and 2/3 and is Manufactured in America.

Description:
Sienna spin reels have been part and parcel of the Shimano lineup for well over a dozen years now, and the latest incarnation certainly raises the standard when it comes to entry-level performance. The compact XGT-7 body has a changed center of gravity, which makes them comfortable for newcomers to fishing to use, while three ball bearing and one roller bearing combine with Dyna-Balance to make winding delightfully smooth. There are three general purpose sizes: 1000, 2500 and 4000, which cover all manner of light line situations, from bait fishing to Squidgy soft plastic and hardbody lure casting. They punch out 8.5kg drag and the AR-C die-cast aluminum spools hold a generous amount of monofilament and a lot more of a braid. So if you’re just starting out in fishing or the kids are showing some interest that requires something more sophisticated than just a basic handline, check out the new Sienna reel.

The new Curado CU200XGM inherits the latest Shimano reel technologies to provide ultimate castability with heavier lines and lures in any power fishing situation. Expanded line capacity comes without compromise as the Curado 200 M now leverages Shimano’s MagnumLite (MGL) Spool III to reduce start-up inertia for unparalleled casting performance, especially when targeting trophies with large paddle-tail swimbaits, big jigs, deepdiving cranks, oversized frogs, Carolina rigs or umbrella rigs. The addition of SilentTune technology improves spool quietness during casts. SVS Infinity technology provides precision casting performance with easyto-manage and consistent spool control and brake force adjustments when faced with demanding conditions or switching between baits. The aluminum HAGANE Body provides added rigidity to increase cranking power and overall reeling efficiency, while MicroModule Gear, Cross Carbon Drag and X-Ship deliver the tournament-tested smoothness, durability, and versatility for which the Curado family is known. Expanding on Curado’s reputation as a do-everything reel, Shimano redesigned and refined the versatile Curado CU200XGM to be all about big casts on big line with big baits for one thing — big fish.

The ATC Combat Plus is designed to take on hard fighting predators.
Featuring a corrosion resistant aluminium frame and side plate, the Combat has a multi-disc drag system that can handle drags up to 5kg.
A lightweight aluminium spool and a magnetic braking system ensure consistency in distance and performance with every cast. The 9+1 stainless steel ball bearing system further enhances the reel's all round smoothness and performance.
The handle, with both left hand and right hand retrieve options, is designed to be ergonomic and is padded for the ultimate in comfort and feel and the reel comes with a spare jigging handle with a power knob for light offshore jigging applications.
Added to the Combat Plus is a spare, shallow and ported, long cast spool. This spool is designed to keep weight down and reduce start up inertia on the cast, thus reducing backlashes and providing easier casting for the dedicated lure caster.
A full crank of the handle allows anglers to recover 68cm of line quickly when needed or slow it all down when necessary, meaning this reel can be used for a number of applications.
Tough, dependable and attractive, the ATC Combat is a reel that will fill many roles.

Fishing,Spinning Rod,Daiwa RX Lure Game 10ft Spinning Rod,3141.0,,"
The RX reed series from Daiwa is here to become the introductory line of reeds, for friends of coastal technicians, who want to start the techniques of Light Rock Fishing, Spinning and Heavy Spinning. The Daiwa company wanted to create a range of reeds that were worthy of its reputation, but at the same time accessible to as many coastal fishermen as possible. With this goal, Daiwa created a unique range of reeds, which allows every fan of Light Game techniques to start fishing with artificial, or silicones, with a flawless rod at a very affordable price.
And this series was named Daiwa RX Lure Game. An economical, but without “savings” series of reeds, made with high standards, without making discounts on the quality of construction and materials. The short Butt of the RX Lure Game Will help the novice Spinner to execute Jerks and Twitches accurately without tiring. All the reeds of the RX Lure Game series have a Hook Holder at the beginning of the butt so that our movements on the rocks become easier without being hindered by our artificial baits. This particular line of reeds of Daiwa is already successful in every respect.

MajorCraft, a leading Japanese fishing tackle brand, has created a rod specifically tailored to the needs of Indian anglers. This groundbreaking development offers superior quality at an economical cost. Indra™, India's own fishing rod, is a remarkable milestone for the angling community.
It took us nearly two years to develop a multi-purpose rod with high-quality blank and Fuji components. Our aim was to make a rod suitable for targeting hard-fighting game fish in India's fresh and saltwater ecosystems, while remaining affordable. We fine-tuned each part of the rod during the creation process to make it a super versatile tool for anglers. Our field testers have thoroughly tested the rod, catching species like Mahaseer, Murrel, Mulley, Barramundi, MJ, Grouper and Rawas. At last, the Indra rod is available and can be shipped across India.
Lightweight high- and mid-modulus blank, ergonomic ""Hard Eva Grip"", Fuij ""MNOG Super Ocean"" guides, medium-heavy action, stylish aesthetics and prints, reliable rod cover - all in one rod.

Jackall BRS 9ft-10ft Shore Jigging Spinning Rod

Extensive lineup for various situations


The ""BRS"" series is compatible with a wide range of shore salt games. As the names of Bay, River, and Surf suggest, we support your fishing with a lineup that responds to various situations and targets.




Target is infinite

Each model is set by target/game. We cover light games such as large migratory fish, root fish, flatfish, horse mackerel, and rockfish, which are the best part of shore casting games.
Features:-




The cool design based on black will satisfy the sense of ownership that you will never get tired of.




Blanks were completed after repeated tests after verifying the fishing type and style. Blanks rolled under pressure using the micro-pitch manufacturing method are both powerful and lightweight.




Optimized settings for Fuji guides to reduce PE line entanglement. The top guide uses a stainless steel frame/SiC guide, and the rest use stainless steel frames/aconite guides.




BRS-S100H-SJ uses Fuji Kogyo's BRC, which has excellent strength, at the grip end. Even when a strong large migratory fish hits, the burden is reduced even when fighting with the grip end against the belly.

Featuring Okuma's patented UFR technology, Ceymar bait caster rods redefine what anglers can expect at an entry-level price. UFR - Unidirectional Fiber Reinforcement is a manufacturing process that utilizes an outer layer of longitudinal fibers around the rod blank to significantly increase the rod's strength and power in the tip section. These fibers increase the rod's lifting power and maximum strength by up to three times that of a standard rod blank.

Jackall BRS 9ft-10ft Shore Jigging Spinning Rod

Extensive lineup for various situations


The ""BRS"" series is compatible with a wide range of shore salt games. As the names of Bay, River, and Surf suggest, we support your fishing with a lineup that responds to various situations and targets.




Target is infinite

Each model is set by target/game. We cover light games such as large migratory fish, root fish, flatfish, horse mackerel, and rockfish, which are the best part of shore casting games.
Features:-




The cool design based on black will satisfy the sense of ownership that you will never get tired of.




Blanks were completed after repeated tests after verifying the fishing type and style. Blanks rolled under pressure using the micro-pitch manufacturing method are both powerful and lightweight.




Optimized settings for Fuji guides to reduce PE line entanglement. The top guide uses a stainless steel frame/SiC guide, and the rest use stainless steel frames/aconite guides.




BRS-S100H-SJ uses Fuji Kogyo's BRC, which has excellent strength, at the grip end. Even when a strong large migratory fish hits, the burden is reduced even when fighting with the grip end against the belly.

High-quality carbon fiber with special internal reinforcing which adds strength and rigidity. Increased wall strength and joint thickness on all sections to eliminate potential stress points. Allows crappie poles to be extremely light while staying strong enough to put up a fight.
SENSITIVITY &amp; SMOOTH: Move the fishing rod back and forth to push the line forward. Then place the flies where the fish are. The fishing rod will bend when fighting with larger fish like trout to distract pressure through the whole rod.
The special portable closed-length design and Ultra-light body make it easy to carry around. They are comfortable to use and cast accurately, smoothly, and with good distance.

The Ceana Pencil from Major Craft is a stickbait, surface walk the dog style lure available in two sizes that will allow you to cover a maximum of different types of fishing and species, both at sea and in fresh water. Very easy to impart an enticing walk the dog action. The Ceana will quickly become a go to lure for your surface fishing for saltwater species such as bass, but also in fresh water for perch pike and other predatory species that hunt on the surface. The Ceana Pencil sits horizontally on the pause.
If you have never tried surface fishing, you’re missing all the fun. It can not only be great fun, prompting heart stopping takes, but can also out fish other techniques when the fish are on the feed, as it makes a commotion on the surface drawing in predators from a greater distance than any other method. Try It, you won’t regret it!

By reducing the count by one or two numbers on each cast, the angler can then easily establish the desired depth and suspend this lure in a variety of depths and conditions.

Pursuing action response and ease of use

The fins attached to the jaws dramatically improve the response of the dog-walking action. It can act firmly even in windy, current-driven, and wavy conditions, expanding the range of fishing techniques. It is also easy to make the lure move, regardless of the angler's experience level, allowing you to experience the fun of manipulating a top water plug.






A versatile all-rounder

By adjusting the line tension and input strength during the dog walk, you can search a wide area with a good tempo by sliding the lure wide, or you can restrict the sliding width and lure the lure by shaking its head tenaciously at one point. Popping has very few errors and troubles, and the sweet popping sound calls to fish over a wide area, making it an effective appeal in rough water conditions.








More than 50m flying distance

The design concentrates the volume and center of gravity on the tail side, allowing for long-distance casting with a stable flying posture. It achieves an outstanding average flight distance of 52.2m*, putting unexplored spots within range and being useful both onshore and offshore. *Average flight distance of 5 casts when using a PE 0.6, leader 10lb, and 7ft 7inch rod. Measured by our company.






Features:-



Fins at the throat

It cuts through the water sharply when doing dog-walking and improves the ability to move straight to the left and right. It is the key part that gives Toppy its distinctive features of high operability and ease of action.
 






Highly functional body shape

At first glance, the body looks like a toy, but the thick tail allows it to carry weight and rectify the wind, dramatically increasing the casting distance. Also, black porgy have a tendency to miss bites when the action slides too much, so the thick tail brakes it and keeps the sliding width to a minimum, increasing the hooking rate.







Standing posture

Most of the body is submerged in water, so it is less likely to bounce off when bitten, reducing missed bites.







Front hook eye positioned slightly further back

It is located just a little behind the center of the body, in an excellent position to prevent it from getting tangled with the line or snapping even when you turn your head or pop.







Teardrop-shaped line eye

We've improved the difficulty of threading the snap, which is common with poppers. The teardrop shape allows the folded part at the end of the snap to be threaded easily.

 When casting:-Because the weighted balls move as a single mass without dispersing, the powerful impact generates propulsive force and creates explosive flight distance.
 when swimming:- The weight balls, which move as one mass, are securely fixed with a strong magnet in the abdomen. This eliminates variations in the centre of gravity and provides stable swimming performance.

It is effective when you want to emphasize the presence of a lure over a wide range of areas, such as in the morning and evening when there is low light, in deep areas, and in rough water, or when you want to attack in a different way.





Swimming type wobbling action with strong water push
Due to the weight balance of the center of gravity movement system and the thick head shape, it lures the target with a strong swimming-like wobbling action.





Wire through structure
Wire-through structure allows for safe interaction with big fish.

TN/70, which is frequently used in large natural lakes representing Lake Biwa. It is an item that can efficiently check offshore weed flats and manmade cover. It is possible to continue using without stress with casting performance that does not face headwinds.
Stable swimming posture and castability, excellent bottom sensing ability. The TN series has characteristics such as good start-response after swimming and fluttering. We have a lineup of 5 sizes of 50/60/65/70/80 and different versions of various internal structures, and as a fishing lure, it has been highly evaluated not only in Japan but also in other countries around the world for many years, including bass. We are proud of our achievements in various game fish in general.
The most important feature is the OMS (Out Metal System) equipped with a forming weight that uses a high specific gravity tungsten material set at the mouth. A low center of gravity due to the weight outside the body. It achieves a stable flight action at all speeds from casting, flight attitude and super slow to fast retrieve, and exhibits excellent bottom sensing ability and agile response to reposition.
In addition, even if the body size is the same, it will be possible to expand the range of fishing by using various versions such as the original, which is the basis of everything, effective silent under high pressure conditions, heavy bass sound and full tungsten with strong wave.
Equipped With ""OMS (Out Metal System)""
Achieves stable swimming posture and castability by mounting ""OMS (Out Metal System)"". In Addition,it has excellent avoidance performance because it does not fall down at the bottom.﻿

Series Lineup
 Lineup from bite size 50 to high impact/ full size 80. All models have inherited the stable flight attitude and balance that does not lose balance from super slow to fast retrieve, which are features of the TN series.

Original Model
An original model with a tungsten ball on the head side and brass ball on the belly side. The treble played by the brass ball echoes over a wide Area.

 FULL TUNGSTEN Model
 An original model with one tungsten ball on the head side and a brass ball on the belly side. The treble played by the  brass ball echoes over a wide area.

SILENT Model
The Weight fixed to the low center of gravity transmits the amplitude power directly to the body. Since the rattle balls do not interfere with each other inside the body, the wave of action becomes Stronger.

Shirasu /plankton/Conquer the Ami pattern

Shirasu are said to be particularly selective and difficult to capture in a pattern where they are picky about transparent or small-grained baits such as whitebait, plankton, and nettle. Solid bodies are effective in such situations. Compared to general hollow body hardbait, there is very little diffused reflection, and it has a sense of transparency and unique texture, allowing even selective rockfish to use their mouths.

Adopts joint structure

Adopts a joint structure that produces a lustrous action like softbait even though it is hardbait. When retrieving slowly, WOBBRING action naturally attracts the fish, and when retrieving quickly, the fast-pitched S-shaped action appeals to the fish.

Compatible with various actions

no-sinker rig design allows for slow fall/retrieval. Based on slow retrieval just below the water surface, a variety of lures are possible, such as lift &amp; fall on the surface/shallow that takes advantage of slow fall, and swinging action that reduces travel distance. 

solid body



The solid body, which is filled with resin and has no air chambers, has a refractive index close to that of baits such as Shirasu, and by naturally adapting to the water, it exhibits extremely high feeding power.



no-sinker rig design

The hook acts as a weight for balance, and there is no-sinker rig inside the body. Since the specific gravity is close to water, it is possible to attack slowly when falling or retrieving just below the water surface, creating a natural floating feeling like a lightweight jig head + softbait. Also, you can make the most of the transparency of the body.

Coloring that takes advantage of the solid body

We have a lineup of 8 clear colors that take advantage of the transparency of the solid body.

Pursues ease of movement. Slim pencil that can be used to lure fish to their feet.


GRANODIVE is a diving pencil designed for ease of movement.

The slim silhouette design also makes it suitable for situations where slender fish such as sardines and barracuda are feeding. And transparent resin is used as the body material. The lure is now available in a lineup of clear colors, previously unavailable in the COLTSNIPER series lures, and is also equipped with FLASH BOOST technology, which boasts a high flashing effect.

Fishing,Hard Lures,Jackall Cian Pencil Serpens 160F-190F | 160mm-190mm |,2159.0,40107240030326," It bites the water firmly when diving, and acts with a slight dive. There are few miss dives even in high scaffolds and thickets, and even inexperienced people can automatically produce ""fishing action""
Based on the S-stroke action, which has high fish-attracting power and is considered very effective for large blue back fish fish, the bait is set to randomly generate a rolling action with small amplitude and high biting power. It is possible to induce a reaction bite by switching the action when blue back fish chased by a fish.
Keel is installed on the left and right on the tail part. It was set to an exquisite height that moderately suppresses the roll and converts it to an S-shaped action, but does not completely erase it. In addition, the arrow feathers are effective during flight, and the flight attitude is stabilized even in crosswinds and headwinds.
Escape slide to aim and eatBy consciously releasing the tension of the rod at the end of jerk action, the inertia of the S-shaped trajectory creates an action that escapes diagonally and laterally.
keel on the tailAppropriately suppresses movement in the roll (rotation) direction and converts it into force in the S-shaped (horizontal) direction. I got a hint from the caudal ridge line of tuna.
Equipped with a magnet center-of-gravity movement systemThe forward weight, which is necessary for the action, is shifted backward only when casting, contributing to the improvement of flight distance.

Penetration wire spot-weldedThe line eye and rear eye are spot-welded, and even if the body is damaged, the hook will remain and the fight can be continued.
High strength thick rib bodyMany ribs are applied to the inside of the body to ensure strength for hard use on the beach.

Fishing,Hard Lures,Duo Tide Minnow Slim 140 | 140mm | 18g | Floating,1664.0,39911580172406,"
 
The Tide Minnow Slim 140 enjoyed its popularity among surf fishing anglers, and the long awaited full model change has arrived. With the modifications on the weight system, the castability has drastically improved. Further, we have adjusted the action and body balance to better suit the ever changing rough conditions in the surf.
We have fine tuned its specifications to better suit the surf game today. To put it into perspective, this new model will feel a little like a model between the Tide Minnow Slim 120 and the 175.
CASTABILITY:
For the moving weight system, the original model used a steel ball which attached to a magnet while swimming, whereas the new model changed to a free-moving tungsten ball. In addition to the change in the weight system, we sharpened the outline of the rear end of the body to reduce air-resistance. With the installation of the heavier tungsten ball which transfers more smoothly within the body, we were able to realize a more stable flight posture resulting in a 10% increase in casting distance.
ACTION RESPONSE:
While maintaining the popular rolling action, we increased the lures water catching ability in order for the lure to sustain balance where the water tends to get rough. This helps anglers to easily feel the complicated current in the surf. In other words, the body of the lure wobbles a little wider than the original model resulting in stronger water resistance. The swimming depth is much deeper at approximately 80 ~ 120cm, whereas the original model swam at 50 ~ 80cm.

Fishing,Hard Lures,Duo International Realis Pencil 85| 85mm | 10g | Floating,1052.0,AJA3055,"With the original 110mm on the market, which was easily controlled to dog-walk by any angler, we have added a model with more emphasis on the “bite”. In addition to the original characteristics of its castability, action and the sphere protruding from its face to improve the rotational performance, a smaller dog-walking action has been added to its values. It will not only be effective in searching a vast area, but will also produce you results in high pressure fields where a tighter approach is required. With the side-to-side dog-walking action inherited from the 110, the pencil 85 will produce a tighter action compared to its predecessor
CASTING PERFORMANCE:
The design of the body form and positioning of the tail hook-eye, reduces the air resistance allowing a stable flight posture. This results in greater casting distance without being affected by wind or casting styles.
ACTION PERFORMANCE:
With its swing design, it stages a brisk and compact “dog-walking” action.
SPLASH &amp; DIVING ACTION:
By retrieving the line slag stronger than usual when the lure reaches the highest point during the “dog-walking”, the lure splashes the water forward while diving.
TWO KNOCK RATTLE SYSTEM:
By the moving weight hitting the secured hard spherical weight in the tail section, it creates a high pitch clicking sound. This appeals to the bass in various water qualities from muddy to clear.

There is hardly anything more heart pumping than smashing predators on surface lures. Hydra will mesmerize an array of species with its dynamic skipping action staying on the surface imitating the movement of needlefish and garfish perfectly.
Hydra is a long type sinking pencil to target the pelagic species from land-based or off-shore fishing. Utilizing the long body design will reduce the chances of large species swallowing the lure whole or biting down on the shock-leader. The slim body has enabled the lure to twitch and jerk with little rod work and will swing its neck from side to side. It will also enact a skipping action dragging the tail on the surface with fast retrieval.  With its small head design and loaded with a fixed weight in the tail section, it responds quickly to the anglers action while highly appealing to the targets. It is most suited for use when the fish are feeding on the surface.

Description:

We present you the slow floating single hook tuned Aomasa 188SF. It is a diving pencil type lure able to conduct a side to side slalom type swimming action, known to be productive for large bluerunners. We have especially released this single hook version for increased hook strength, reduction in drag during its casting and its outstanding ability to reduce hook-offs during the fight.
(1) A straight eye from the hook for easier use with plugs. (2) A welded eye + flat sided for extra strength. (3) Astonishing rust repelling abilities with the unique “Ultra-anti-rusting processing”.
The straight eye from the hook is most suited for plugs allowing for greater balance and the thinly shaved hook eye reduces the damage when attaching split-rings. In addition, the hook-eye is also welded on for greater strength. The main shaft of the hook is flattened for increased strength while helping the point to penetrate easier. The “Ultra-anti-rusting processing” will help anglers maintain their gear and hooks in mint condition.


Note: The lure is with hook.

The crawler fins can be removed by hand turning the screws on each side, transforming it into a popper.

Makora is the classic series of twitch-baits designed in two sizes of 110 mm and 130 mm particularly popular for angling predatory fish.


 The wobblers of these series are distinguished by their unique play they demonstrate during both jerking and even guiding. By deviating from the line of guiding and moving in wide tacks, these wobblers attract pike.

 Its fusiform body combined with the weight specially designed by Lucky John specialists makes the wobbler move from side to side and turning a little around its aisle when jerking, thus perfectly affecting predatory fish during the pause.

This lure is designed to perform a sinuous yet not too accentuated or nervous swimming, like that of a dazed forage fish that wanders inside the school or dares to comes out, exposing itself to the jaws of the predators. 
It is an action that Tunas and other similar species approve, accompanied by an swinging in the fall capable of triggering the strike even during the breaks of the retrieve. The micro bib orchestrate the performance either with a linear motion or under the pressure of vigorous jerks, widening the snaking action and producing irregular skids. 
The bait obviously includes thru wire skeleton and the sturdy and reinforced body consents to endless casts with no loss of stability, allowing to safely cope with the greatest predators of the sea, such as Bluefin Tunas.SINKINGLength: 11,7 cm (4.5/8 in)Weight: 42 g (1.1/2 oz)",https://cabraloutdoors.com/collections/hard-lure/products/molix-casting-jig-minnow-115-batfish-series-col-peark,['https://cabraloutdoors.com/cdn/shop/products/15_63.png?v=1656154702&width=1024'],0,0.0,Lures

This small wobbler with a thick body and the size of 33 mm is a lure of crank-bait class and comes only in the floating version with a small dropping blade. The maximum dropping of the lure at fast reeling is just 20 cm. Once stopped, the wobbler quickly surfaces, thus allowing effective reeling, while successfully avoiding underwater obstacles: water vegetation and snags. At steady reeling, the lure moves with intense playing: vibrating with high frequency with all its body at minimum amplitude. The wobbler creates a noticeable wave behind it, which attracts any predatory fish. Due to the OSS system, all of the Haira Tiny Shallow Pilot wobblers have additional vibration of the lure during the reeling and increased flying range.

• Line Thru Construction• 4X Hooks• Large Rattle Chamber• High-Quality Holographic, UV and Superglow Finish• Erratic Swimming Action
Starting with the eye candy, this 3.5-inch bait comes in four proven inshore/coastal colors: Greenie, Gold Black Back, Chrome Sardine, White Glow, Peanut Bunker and Chartreuse. No matter what water clarity and/or sky conditions you encounter, there’s a color for your day.
Adding to the bait’s convincing presence are finely crafted features like prominent eyes, molded mouth, gills, pectoral fins and scale patterns and a realistic baitfish profile. Aggressive predators may be less discerning, but when the bite is tough, these convincing details will push indecisive fish over the edge.
Complementing the Twitch Reaper’s visual appeal, a large internal rattle creates the high-pitch sonic attraction that sounds like a school of nervous baitfish. This sensory stimulant proves effective at calling in fish from afar and exciting those nearby.
Once a fish commits, the Twitch Reaper’s grabs hold with an unfailing grip, thanks to a pair of high quality 4X strong treble hooks that won’t straighten out. Solidifying the bait’s design, a sturdy through wire system prevents the hooks from being pulled out — a failure that can occur with standard hook anchors. Built with equal attention to attracting bites and capitalizing on them, the Twitch Reaper exemplifies the balance between performance and strength.

The secret to the Mischief Minnow’s performance is the unique custom-shaped patent-pending Kilter blade design which is center-mounted on the bait's body by an angled blade pin.
Working the bait is simple with a steady retrieve - relying on the custom blade design combined with the side-to-side body rolling action which mimics a wounded baitfish on the water’s surface. The Mischief Minnow’s unique thrashing action combines sound, wake vibration, and Kilter blade flash – a true triple threat in topwater fishing.
At rest, the high float body relies on a nose-up presentation that thrashes into action with the slightest twitch. Use a straight retrieve or mix it up with a pause-and-rip rod technique to entice bone-jarring strikes! 
The Mischief Minnow is designed to put fish in the boat with premium paint finishes, super-sharp Gamakatsu short shank treble hooks, and the exclusive Freedom Color-Matched Custom Shaped Kilter Blades.

The Roosta Popper 160 is designed and built to get the maximum noise and splash out of a medium-sized popper while retaining superior casting capability, excellent strength, and high durability.
Excessive effort is not required when working this popper. For best results point the rod tip at the lure and sweep the rod down 50-60 degrees, allow the lure to pause momentarily, wind in any slack line, and repeat at irregular intervals.
The highly distinctive head shape of the Roosta 160 provides a long and extremely noisy bubble trail by alloying the cavitation bubbles and the subsequent noise to escape via the popper’s contoured cup sides.

The Zerek Thermite popper is built to withstand the harshest of punishment from the toughest fish and still ask for more.
Ready to rumble straight from the packet, the thermite popper will ignite some serious explosions from serious predators.
The Thermite Popper has been designed with an extra thick wall to allow this popper to be used and abused and maintain its performance. Tough customers like GTs, mackerel, red bass, coral trout, and tuna will find no give in this super-strong body. Sharp teeth, teeth made for punching through baitfish and simple speed through the water will have little impact on this lure.
The body strength is complemented by a through a wire that connects the tow point to the hook hangers, ensuring anything you hook stays that way. This is a vital ingredient when oversized fish are the target. You do not want hook hangers pulling out of the lure as a brutal fish slugs it out down deep.
The addition of 6x Mustad hooks and oversized forged split rings is a sure sign that this lure's design has been taken very seriously indeed. Like the body and the through a wire, making sure you stay connected is the name of the game with every part of the Zerek Thermite Popper's design.
A weighted tail allows this lure to sit in a perfect position when paused, ready to create some serious commotion with every sweep of the rod. The bloop and bubble trail this lure creates attracts predators from afar. The tail weight also aids casting distance by reducing tumbling through the air and aligning the lure through the air for the entire cast.
Available in 50-57g (140mm) and in 8 striking colors that imitate baitfish.

Brand Name: Rapala
The DT® (Dives-To) series of crankbaits, dive fast to a preset depth and stay in the “strike zone” longer than any than other crankbait on the market. Made from balsa wood combined with carefully placed internal weights, tapered fuselage, and thin tail design creates the ultimate crankbait action, found only in the DT family. Ultra-thin polycarbonate lip digs the bait down quickly to the desired depth with aid of small metal disc permanently embedded in the lip. Swimming with a side-to-side action only balsa crankbaits can achieve, the DT cranks deep, yet pulls with ease. Perfectly weighted to rest in a “quick-dive” nose down position allowing for immediate descent to the desired depth, the DT® can be easily cast 150 feet. Simply put, the farther the cast, the longer the bait stays in the strike zone. It's the most effective way to cover more water and catch more fish. The internal baritone rattle is tuned for best sound performance. Premiere finishes in all the right color patterns finished with 3D holographic or painted eyes. All come with premium VMC® black nickel hooks. Each lure is hand-tuned and tank-tested to swim perfectly right out of the box.

Description:
The WTD 90T is a small top water “walking the dog”. It was born from a collaboration between Molix and Jack Fin, thanks to the experience achieved from the bigger model of 15 cms (WTD 150T). Even in this case, initially the bait was handcrafted. It was developed industrially respecting the original draw and became a summary of quality and advantages of an ABS housing with millimeter tolerances, typical of the realization in series. It has a traditional walking the dog action, but with a new fluidity and a typical action of a pencil bait, which allows many customizations of the retrieval action. Important details, like the scales in relief, are worthy of an artisan and collectible bait. The “full wire” armor made of stainless steel and the SW treble hooks of high quality makes it a reliable and high-performance bait for Mediterranean predators such as bluefish, seabass and other small pelagic fish. It gives good results also in fresh water, with predators such as black bass and asps due to the size of this topwater bait, it perfectly mimics a small bait fish.

Description:
﻿Featuring a slow sinking hard body lure, it's rear weighting counteracts the small size of the lure, which is ideal for gaining more control and casting distance. Whether you are slow-rolling or twitching the lure back towards you, remember to pause the Laser Pro 45 every now and then.
The Laser Pro 45 can be kept in the strike zone for longer with it's stop and start retrieve method which increases your chances of triggering a strike from the fish. Before you use this lure, you can try and work out how long it takes to sink for say a meter which in turn gives you an idea of when you should start your retrieve in the depth of water you are fishing in. 
Features:

It is ideal for bream through to flathead in the salt.
It is also ideal for bass through to trout in the fresh.

Description:
This Rapala Shallow Shad Rap is constructed from premium balsa wood and has a precisely engineered “L” shaped lip. Said to be perfect for skinny water, the shallow running lip keeps it closer to the surface, and allows it to still maintain the classic Rapala “wounded-minnow” wobble that fish love. Simply cast the Rapala Shallow Shad Rap and allow it to sit until the ripples subside, then slowly retrieve it back to the boat. Bounce it off of stumps, rocks and any other structure in the area, it generates vicious reaction strikes.

Anglers can cast further and cover more water than ever before due to the Yo-Zuri Mag Minnow Floating Series's Magnetic Weight Transfer System. These Minnows are most productive when cast and slow retrieved, along with being twitched and paused during the retrieve for increased performance and strike response. The Mag Minnow Series has a tight wiggling action that makes this bait irresistable to both fresh and saltwater game fish. The bait can cast straight, even in a strong wind with the help of the Minnow's Magnetic Weight Transfer System.

Said as a new, freshwater optimized version of Yo-Zuri's well-known and time-tested Crystal Minnow series of jerkbaits/ripbaits, these jerkbaits have Yo-Zuri's distinctive flat sides along with a spectacular line up of both natural baitfish and exotic, bold color schemes (some of which feature ""Prism Finishes""). Coming in three sizes (3 1/2 inch, 4 3/8 inch, and 5 1/2 inch), this series of lures has got you covered in all sorts of forage size preference and water clarity conditions, murky to clear, small to large, and virtually everything in between. In addition to that, the Freshwater Crystal Minnow series of jerkbaits are super-tough, true running jerkbaits that flat out catch fish by perfectly mimicking the erratic action of a dying baitfish.

Description:
The Killalure Cone Popper is best fished with a stop-start retrieve that includes plenty of sharp rod jerks to allow it’s oversized cupped face ‘bloop’ and ‘pop’ loudly on the surface. This loud blooping noise, combined with the big splash of water is an effective strike trigger for a wide range of predatory species. Great when fished in creeks &amp; rivers for Barra, Jacks and Trevally. Also cast it around rocks, reef and other ocean structure for pelagics including Tuna, Mackerel, Queenfish, GT’s, Tailor, Salmon, Bonito, Kingfish and most other surface feeders.

Description
The Laser Pro 120  STD is a modern take on a classic lure design.  It features multiple trebles. This makes it a Mouth-Trap for vicious ambush predators, like the unsuspecting barramundi and mangrove jack.This lure is designed for precision casting applications and has a floating body. The LP120STD has sticky sharp, fine gauge forged hooks for great hook sets while retaining superior holding ability. Available in clear and fully painted finishes, the Laser Pro 120STD is taking you back to the future and comes in 1meter diving depths.


When the Laser Pro 120 is cast, the weights move to the rear of the lure giving a straight trajectory, and upon retrieval, the weights lock in place back towards the front of the lure. The Laser Pro 120 is famous for its incredible action when using the “rip and stop” technique.
Pull the lure fast through the water using the rod then retrieve the slackline and repeat it again, this will often attract a strike from even the wariest predators.
Use the “rip and stop” technique on the standard version for explosive surface strikes. Note that when the lure stops moving it is pointing slightly left or right with the nose slightly down. It is in the ideal position for immediate and erratic action when ripped. The Laser Pro 120 is also ideal for a slow retrieve with light twitching movement from the rod tip.

The DT® (Dives-To) series of crankbaits, dive fast to a preset depth and stay in the “strike zone” longer than any than other crankbait on the market. Made from balsa wood combined with carefully placed internal weights, tapered fuselage, and thin tail design creates the ultimate crankbait action, found only in the DT family. Ultra-thin polycarbonate lip digs the bait down quickly to the desired depth with aid of small metal disc permanently embedded in the lip. Swimming with a side-to-side action only balsa crankbaits can achieve, the DT cranks deep, yet pulls with ease. Perfectly weighted to rest in a “quick-dive” nose down position allowing for immediate descent to the desired depth, the DT® can be easily cast 150 feet. Simply put, the farther the cast, the longer the bait stays in the strike zone. It's the most effective way to cover more water and catch more fish. The internal baritone rattle is tuned for best sound performance. Premiere finishes in all the right color patterns finished with 3D holographic or painted eyes. All come with premium VMC® black nickel hooks. Each lure is hand-tuned and tank-tested to swim perfectly right out of the box.

Trolling Speed: 0.5 to 3 Knots
Hooks: #2 Mustad 5XX Trebles
Applications: Trolling, Casting
Description:
The ultimate crash diver is the Poltergeist 80. This means that the moment you start retrieving the lure it dives almost straight down. This makes it ideal for casting to structures where there is limited room and you require the lure to get as deep as possible and as quickly as possible. When casting, the Poltergeist 80 allows the maximum time at a deep depth. When trolling the lure dives deep quickly and travels along at around 5 meters with a shuffling action.The Poltergeist 80 is ideal where the lure is being dragged over a rock bar or shallow area (say 4 meters deep). It will travel over the bottom, hitting it regularly, but when it reaches the other side of the feature (where the water gets deep again) it immediately tries to crash-dive down the other side. This is often where large predatory fish are waiting and this lure dives straight to them. This makes crash divers ideal when trolling from a shallower area over a deep drop off.

Brand Name: Halco
Trolling Speed: 1-7 Knots
Hooks: #1 Mustad 3XX Trebles
Description: 
Although mainly trolled, the 150 is a great casting lure for big salt and freshwater species. The “butterknife” tail aid in easy casting and the lure quickly descends to the depth engraved on the lure bib. When trolling areas of structure, the buoyancy of the lure and the “butterknife” tail allow the lure to back off any snags after the line has been allowed to slacken off. It may not work every time but is essential when trolling down close to structure that may snag your lure.To achieve an even faster-trolling speed, remove the center hook. If you wish to use heavier hooks, then use Mustad 2/0’s on the front and rear hook hanger. Do not put one on the center hook hanger. It will upset the balance of the lure as well as causing hook meshing.

Originally designed for Sea Bass, the Sea Bass Minnow from Storm has found its way into tackle boxes worldwide. Though its application has broadened from sea bass to a range of species both in freshwater and in salt. This slim-lined delicacy flies flawlessly over the water during a cast, and rattles and shakes with a wide rolling action just under it. The internal long-cast mechanism doubles as a seductive rattle during a standard retrieve. As a slow rising floater, the Sea Bass Minnow allows anglers to fish heavy structure and plot tactical retrieve courses which allow the lure to pass through many otherwise, forbidding areas - often the habitats of big predatory game fish. Take advantage of the Sea Bass Minnow's aerodynamic design; utilize this lure during circumstances where others may not perform at their peak, such as shore-based angling where casting to likely looking spots may otherwise be out of reach; or when facing a strong headwind - Storm's Sea Bass Minnow cuts through the atmosphere with ease.

Great choice for your tackle box Our Story GT Ice cream lures originated in South Africa and were made originally for the giant trevally (GT’s) that hunt the warm waters of the Indian Ocean. The story of the name comes from one of the guys originally prototyping them when he said the GT’s hit the plug so hard and so much, that it was like ice cream to them! With great success in the Indian Ocean, we thought the plugs would work well all over the world.

Applications: Casting, Trolling
Widely recognized as Australia’s best Barramundi lure, this amazing lure has incredible versatility. The four depths range from less than a meter to over 8 meters. The tight trademark Sorcerer shimmy action is the ideal strike trigger and the butterknife tail give exceptional hook exposure and the flat reflective surface which creates a huge flash on the chrome finishes. Trolling speeds ranging from 1 knot to 5 knots are ideal and twitching of the rod at low trolling speeds will achieve greater action with a more erratic movement.These Sorcerers are bib towed. Halco designed the special towing links that insert into the bib – they are now industry standard. Are the bibs strong? – yes very strong! The bib has been tested by Australian Monofil Company (the makers of the Australian made Platypus Fishing lines) They actually pull out at 145 pounds! These are Bullet proof bibs, designed by Halco and utilise a key and keyway to align the bib perfectly and hold it in tight. Remember, let the unique design do the holding – do not use any glue, it will weaken the plastic. We leave gluing to our competitorsDives to over 5m. A must for Barra. Its tight action and body roll with a light rattle makes it one of the classic Barra lures. Also great for Jacks, Threadfin, Salmon, Fingermark, Flathead, Trevally.

When the Laser Pro 120 is cast, the weights move to the rear of the lure giving a straight trajectory, and upon retrieval, the weights lock in place back towards the front of the lure. The Laser Pro 120 is famous for its incredible action when using the “rip and stop” technique.Pull the lure fast through the water using the rod then retrieve the slack line and repeat it again, this will often attract a strike from even the wariest predators.Use the “rip and stop” technique on the standard version for explosive surface strikes. Note that when the lure stops moving it is pointing slightly left or right with the nose slightly down. It is in the ideal position for an immediate and erratic action when ripped. The Laser Pro 120 is also ideal for a slow retrieve with light twitching movement from the rod tip.

The Sensy series specializes in surf finesse

""Surf finesse"" is a delicate approach using lightweight jig heads and worms to get even the most wary fish in high-pressure areas to bite. The SENSY series of worms/jig heads specializing in this strategy are not only delicate in action, but also easy to handle in the special field of surfing, and a lineup that can be adjusted to a wide range of situations, making them the perfect fit for surf finesse.








A wide range of searches that make the most of your appeal

This is the model with the best searching ability in the series, and the highly responsive tail has a strong action from the moment you start reeling it in, appealing to a wide range of fish. It is particularly useful when searching a wide area as a pilot worm, and also when you need to appeal to a lot of fish, such as when there is a lot of bait.









Tail power adjust function

At the base of the tail, there is a notch that allows you to adjust the action power according to the situation, and by removing that part, you can weaken the power and resistance of the tail one level. This also reduces the lifting, allowing you to adjust the range.







Features:-



A tail that can handle a wide range of flow speeds

It has a solid action regardless of the weight of the jig head, the strength of the current, or the speed of the retrieve. It has good response that does not stop moving even slowly, and a sense of stability that does not break down even with fast movements.







Body shape for improved lift and distance

The body shape with a bulging belly has a wide surface area that receives the current and has good floatation, so it can also be used to fish in shallow surf.







Soft Materials

It lures with a seductive action and bends easily when bitten, providing outstanding hooking performance.







Great with the Sub-Sensitive Jig Head

By using the Sensey Jig Head, you can maximize all performance including range control, casting distance, and hooking.

The Cultiva Ring Kick Tail Tasty Worm is a standout in the Ultra Light Rock Fishing (ULRF) community. This ringed/ribbed paddle tail lure is renowned for its self-vibrating and wobbling action, making it highly effective even on the drop. Its design triggers strikes from predatory fish as it falls, ideal for On-the-Drop (OTD) fishing. Part of the Rock’n Bait series, these lures feature a subtle flavor and flexible ribbed body, enhancing underwater movement. Rigging on a light jig head (0.5 grams) ensures an attractive vibration during descent. Versatile in both OTD and cast-and-retrieve styles, this lure excels in staying longer in the strike zone.

Kicktail with the image of small fish and shrimp. If you want to attack a point with a lot of roots tightly, the trick is to set the offset hook Tetra Master, which has a high weedless effect, combine curve fall, slide, and retrieve, and wind it slowly as long as the tail moves. For points with relatively little rooting, use rockfish shots and bottom shots and invite them with a curve fall.

Fishing,Soft Baits,"Zerek Live Mullet 5.5"" | 35g | #1",857.0,,"Description:
The Zerek Live Mullet is a soft plastic jointed swimbait. Built from the super-strong TPE thermoplastic, the live mullet uses the same concept as the widely acclaimed live shrimp - to emulate natural prey movements to trigger strikes.
To achieve this goal, the designers used a segmented body that is held together with a Kevlar webbing, giving strength and unparalleled freedom of movement. The main body section hides an ingeniously designed one-piece wire frame that connects the tow point to the hook hanger, giving even more strength. Easily workable with a straight retrieve, the life-like 3D eyes and detailed finishes (natural and attractor patterns) make the Zerek Live Mullet an essential addition to your tackle kit whether that's chasing barra, chasing Murray cod, chasing mulloway, and everything in between.

The tail design of the 4” Grub differs to the parallel tail of the smaller 2.5” size since, it is more often fished with heavier weight heads and doesn’t have the same requirement of incredibly slow swim speeds on the fall as the 2.5”.  As larger sized baits tend to be used in deeper water or dirtier water chasing more estuarine sportfish species, the rolled over tail design of the 4” Grub creates more disturbance in the water, allowing predators to key in on the bait even when the water is not clear.
A rigging line is prominent on both the top and bottom sides of the body for those who prefer a tail up or down rigging method. The BaitJunkie 4” Grub is an ideal choice for shallow water snapper, estuarine flathead and many more species throughout Australia. 
Features:

Amino X-Natural Flavor and Scent.
Elastomax Material-Incredible Stretch and Durability.
Floating Material
The BaitJunkie 4” Grub comes in 5 pieces per pack.

DESCRIPTION

Featuring a segmented, fish-shaped body and a forked tail that creates an extremely lifelike baitfish profile, the RaZor ShadZ pulls double duty as a first-of-its-kind floating/diving soft plastic jerkbait and the perfect bladed swim jig trailer to complement the new Project Z™ ChatterBait®. When fished unweighted on a 3/0 or 4/0 EWG style hook, the RaZor ShadZ floats on the surface at rest, yet a broad, sloped head causes the bait to dive on a twitching retrieve, creating a floating/diving action that cannot be duplicated by other soft baits. The RaZor ShadZ doubles as a perfect bladed swim jig trailer when conditions call for a bulkier ChatterBait profile to mimic full-bodied forage like bream, shad and herring.




FEATURES



Segmented fish-shaped body and forked tail create an extremely lifelike baitfish profile
Ideally suited as a bladed swim jig trailer when conditions call for a bulkier profile to mimic full-bodied forage
Belly slot and dorsal pocket allow for easy weedless rigging on a 3/0 or 4/0 EWG style hook
When rigged weightless, bait dives when twitched and exhibits an erratic darting motion and slow rise on the pause that is deadly on bass and redfish alike
Made in the USA

From the makers of the Original Vudu Shrimp, Egret Baits announces a new ""Weedless"" version for anglers. Made from ""TOUGH AS HELL"" TPE, the new Vudu Weedless is designed for gliding through and over grass. It's perfect for the coastal marshes along the Gulf Coast. It can also be used in open water when a ""gliding"" action may be better suited. It allows a slower presentation.
It has a wider tail to give it balance and buoyancy as you work it slowly through the shallows. The Vudu Weedless comes with a belly style hook configuration which makes it much more weedless than our traditional Vudu Shrimp. Rigged with a wide gap 3.0 hook, gives it plenty of ""bite"" in the hook.

This bait is also ideally suited for rigging on the EZ KeeperZ Weighted Hooks or similar swimbait hooks for shallow flats, where the naturally buoyancy of the ElaZtech material allows it to float off the bottom at a perfectly natural angle to trigger strikes from redfish, seatrout, and flounder alike!







FEATURES




The Z-Man Trout Trick Jerk ShrimpZ mimic the jet-propulsion swimming motion of fleeing shrimp.


Tail-first design for backward frantic swimming action.


Appendages, twin-paddle antennae, and tucked-under tail for amazing action.


Ideal for targeting sea trout, redfish, snook, flounder, and small tarpon.

The 5"" Jerk ShadZ is ideal for popular inshore targets like redfish, seatrout, flounder, and snook, while freshwater bass anglers have found it to be effective as both a surface twitch bait for largemouth and a drop-shot bait for outsized smallmouth. An upsized version of its 5"" little brother, the 7"" Jerk ShadZ is a deadly search and reaction bait for stripers, bull reds, snook, tarpon, cobia, pike, and musky. Both size Jerk ShadZ is also incredibly effective when pinned to a heavy jighead and jigged vertically for grouper, snapper, amberjack, and yellowtail, where they not only trigger violent strikes but also hold up to constant abuse from bait-stealers like no other scented soft plastics on the market!

Built with a new injection process each Bobby’s Perfect Frog is made with a consistent shape and super soft hollow body, so they collapse easily to expose the razor-sharp hooks.

To keep the Snag Proof Bobby's Perfect Frog in the optimal heads-up position that allows it to jump into action with the first twitch of your rod, it’s been re-engineered with a molded rear button weight that will never fall out. Taking its performance a leap further, an innovative water evacuation system naturally expels any water infiltration during a cast for unbeatable buoyancy and consistent performance. Boasting custom paint schemes designed and created by award-winning lure designer Andrew Gardner, the Snag Proof Bobby's Perfect Frog delivers unbelievably good looks that equally match its peerless performance.

Description
As the name implies, these frogs are typically found in very tall trees or other high-growing vegetation. They do not normally descend to the ground, except to mate and spawn, though some build foam nests on leaves and rarely leave the trees at all as adults.  Many tree frogs can change their color for better camouflage. For instance, the gray tree frog can change its color from green to gray.  Tree frogs bodies are relatively tiny and both its finger and toe tips are designed to graps on trees. MegaFrox Tree Frog Jr. Lures are exactly designed to the real-life tree frog species that you see find in the wild.  Tree Frog Jr lures are made to match its real-life sizes and therefore tree frog lures are perfect lures for fishing predatory fishes that are commonly found hanging around the overhead tree branches near the water surface and waiting for the opportunity that one prey will fallen into the water or hanging out too near to the water surface.

The leopard frog is perhaps most recognizable as the formaldehyde-soaked specimen in the high school lab tray. Leopard frogs are named so for the array of irregularly shaped dark spots that adorn their backs and legs. They are greenish-brown in color with a pearly white underside and light-colored ridges on either side of their backs. Leopard frogs generally live near ponds and marshes, but will often venture into well-covered grasslands as well, earning them their other common name, the meadow frog. Leopard frogs will eat just about anything they can fit in their mouths. They sit still and wait for prey to come by, then pounce with their powerful legs. They eat beetles, ants, flies, worms, smaller frogs, including their own species, and even birds, and garter snakes. Leopard Frog lures are designed to create a subtle popping sound and on the steady speed retrieve it will splash and pushes water on the surface. Leopard frog lures are ideally can be use for places where the fishing pressures are high.

Description
Red-Eyed frogs are found in tropical lowlands from southern Mexico, throughout Central America, and in northern South America. Nocturnal carnivores, they hide in the rain forest canopy and ambush crickets, flies, and moths with their long, sticky tongues.
These iconic rain-forest amphibians sleep by day stuck to leaf-bottoms with their eyes closed and body markings covered. When disturbed, they flash their bulging red eyes and reveal their huge, webbed orange feet and bright blue-and-yellow flanks. This technique, called startle coloration, may give a bird or snake pause, offering a precious instant for the frog to spring to safety. Lures Factory’ Red Eyed Frog Jr. are just designed to mimic the actual Red Eyed Frogs in the wild.
Red eyed frogs are designed in such a way that it can glide through the top water obstacles such as weed and etc, with relatively small body, Red Eyed Frogs able to create water disturbance to attract fishes.

Fishing,Jigs / Spoon / Spinner,Jackall Good Meal Spin Blade+ 5g-7g|52mm-58mm,480.0,42160903585910,"The Goodmeal Spin Blade + is a small tail spin that can be used with any type of fish and in any location . It has an additional blade, making it the Goodmeal Spin Blade+. The target fish are the same as before, small migratory fish such as mackerel, horse mackerel, and barracuda at sea fishing parks and embankments, and black porgy and sea bass (seigo size) in rivers, but the additional blade makes it possible to generate stronger flashing (reflection) and vibration (water movement).
Despite its small body, it has a strong appeal and can attract fish from a wider range. It is also effective in situations where it is difficult for fish to notice you, such as during dim light or when the water is murky. Although it has more parts, there are very few problems, so you can enjoy fishing comfortably.
The basic usage is simple, just wind it in. The two blades attached to the tail and hook rotate to appeal to fish. Available in 5g and 7g sizes, the trick to increasing your catch is to use the right one depending on the water depth and the layer where the fish are swimming. It also supports lift and fall, which moves the rod up and down. This action is effective for rockfish and rockfish that hide near walls such as embankments and around tetrapods.Aim for more catches with the Good Meal Spin Blade+, which has big power in its small body!

With outstanding flight distance and trouble-free performance. By concentrating the centre of gravity on the face, the flight posture is stable and you can fly further. In addition, the bulge on the face suppresses the movement of the hook, reducing the trouble of carrying the hook or getting tangled. 
Comes with a snap that is convenient for changing lures. Lures can be changed without retying the line. 
The blade uses a specifically designed original blade that rotates firmly even in the fall and continues to attract fish.

Jackall Flag Trap Leaf |40g

A flat body that dances like a leaf

The flat shape design enables a slower fall than the original model. This slow action is very effective when aiming for rock fish, flat fish, Red sea bream, etc., which are not good at preying on fast-moving prey.
Basic action

Since there are many fish near the bottom where slow action is effective, please invite them by lift and fall centring on the bottom after landing. In addition, it is recommended for beginners who are not used to the operation because it grabs the water firmly even when it is steadily reeling.
Comes standard with a hook with a tie

Equipped as standard with an assist hook with a tie set. By being conspicuous in the water, it becomes a bite marker, encourages bite on the hook, and contributes to improving the hooking-up rate.
features:-
cup shape

A stream of water is created on the cup side during the fall, creating a slower fall.

Asymmetrical design

By increasing the difference between the left and right volumes, you can quickly and reliably shift to the fall posture (horizontal posture).

Front center of Gravity Design

Place the center of gravity slightly forward. It contributes not only to slow falls but also to stabilizing posture during swimming.

Description:


Recently, slow jigging has taken off and proved itself as a productive method of catching various species. The Drag Metal Cast slow has been developed through careful evaluation of the method and how it is so productive.
The asymmetrical flat side of the body creates a short pitched fluttering during the fall, giving fish a short but necessary time to bite, while reducing the drag against the lure which can be quite stressful for anglers fishing all day long.
This asymmetrical aspect of the lure tends to affect casting distance, but through subtle weight balance distribution, we have overcome this problem, giving it outstanding casting distance.
In order to reduce snags, it is loaded with two assist hooks on the front (with tinsels) and one assist hook at the rear.

The compact yet fat body has enabled anglers to achieve outstanding casting distance. Furthermore, its stable swimming ability and horizontal sliding action during the fall will mesmerize the fish through simple reeling of the lure or a combination of jerking and twitching.

AYU spoon-baits are the most popular lures for trout angling, since “finding a key” to angling of this fish is the easiest with these lures. They have classic shape of a stretched drop, slightly bent profile of the body and the centre of gravity shifted to the tail. Thanks to the shape of the body, these spinners have good aerodynamic qualities and, hence, greater casting range. 
The lures are highly efficient when angling the fish in shallow water and mid-water. Once the lure gets into the water, it creates an attractive splash for the trout. The heaviest spinner might be dragged practically along the bottom at slow reeling.

Fishing,Jigs / Spoon / Spinner,Lucky John Bonnie Blade Spinner | Size: #1-#5 | 2.7-13.4g,365.0,39699275120758,"


Bonnie Blade is a new series of Lucky John spinners. These lures combine modern design solutions that ensure reliable and stable playing of spinners and, most importantly, make them very attractive for any predatory fish. A spinning blade is the main element of the spinners. It is lightweight, is made of brass, and has good dynamic properties when spinning in the water, thus it allows performing reeling of the lure at minimum speed. The blade is wound up as soon as the spinner starts to move. The blades are painted from both sides. No matter from which side the fish is looking, the blade’s color will remain the same and attractive, which increases the interest of the fish in the lure and, as a result, ends up in an effective attack. Another important element is a mandrel, which influences the weight and casting range of the lure, as well as its stability in the water. Two types of mandrels are used in Bonnie Blade spinners: balls and cylindrical. Thanks to the main ball, the center of gravity of the spinner are shifted to its tail end, thus increasing the casting range of its smaller models. A cylindrical mandrel of larger models is made of brass with crosswise grooves, which, undoubtedly, increase the lure’s attractiveness, as well as stabilize its horizontal position when moving in the water. Metal ball-bearings and a reflective cone are intended for easy spinning of the blade around its axis and prevent its “sticking”. Rigid fixing wire of the blade, which is made of steel unriveted wire drilled from the sides, ensures complete freedom of spinning of the blade with minimum friction with the axis of the lure. All the trebles have a bright fly, the main function of which is to take away all the doubts from the predatory fish ready to attack. Moreover, the fly plays the role of a stabilizer of horizontal stability. The base of the spinner is stainless carbon wire. Its axis will not deform in extreme situations, and the lure will always be in operable condition.

This casting jig catches a large variety of fish from the top of the water column to the bottom by changing your retrieve speed.
When reeled in, the jig’s Kick Tail moves naturally to attract fish as the body design displaces water. On the fall, it creates life-like wobbling action and ultimately shakes the rubber skirted tail as well. The jigs body has a distinct flashing appeal and its natural action will trigger many species of fish to strike. One of the most effective techniques is to lift and drop the jig slowly and continuously around the bottom, especially when targeting fluke or rockfish.

Description:
The Mepps Aglia spinner is the original French spinner. It is the World's #1 Lure. More trophy fish have been caught on the Mepps Aglia than any other lure. The Mepps Aglia is extremely popular with fishermen world-wide because it will catch just about any freshwater fish and many species of saltwater fish. 
Lure size is important. Plain spinners present a smaller profile than dressed spinners, so they will appear smaller to the fish. This makes them perfect for panfish and small stream trout. Fishing with dressed spinners can produce larger fish, but, when stream trout fishing, you will probably catch more fish using plain spinners.

All Mepps Aglia Longs are deep running spinners with willow leaf blades. The blade ""hugs"" the body of the spinner during retrieve, allowing it to stay in deep pockets long enough to attract a wide variety of fish.
Lure size is important. Keep in mind plain spinners present a smaller profile than dressed spinners, so they will appear smaller to the fish. This makes them perfect for panfish and small stream trout. 
A #00 Aglia Long is an Ultra Lite spinner. It weighs only 1/18 oz. A #4 Aglia Long, by contrast weighs 1/2 oz. The Mepps Aglia Long, in all styles, like the Mepps Aglia, is extremely popular with fishermen world-wide because it will catch just about any freshwater fish and many species of saltwater fish.
Plain Aglia Longs in size #1 are perfect for larger stream trout. Size #1, #2, &amp; #3 plain Aglia Longs are excellent for smallmouth bass and walleye. Plain Aglia Longs in sizes #3 and #4 are ideal for large rainbow trout and steelhead, as well as coho (silver) and chinook (king) salmon.

Description:
This Mepps model is specially designed for large predators. The large size of the leaf makes the loot looks bigger and more attractive to the fish. From technical point of view, the vibration signals shift to lower frequency levels. This combination of perceptions led to adapt the speed of the harvest to obtain low frequency signals that cause the attack of the predator. AGLIA No 7 takes under consideration this phenomenon. It attracts larger fish which normally remains reluctant to chasing smaller fish which is difficult to catch due to its quick motion. AGLIA No 7 is recommended when you are fishing pike, catfish, salmon.

The flexible axle of the Mepps Tandem gives the lure an utmost fluidity of movement. In better conformity with the natural swimming pattern of the prey fish, this very suppleness increases significantly the triggering effect of the tandem as it allows the angler to subtly vary and adapt its fishing action.Moreover, during the fight it makes it almost impossible for the predator to get unhooked through a twisting action onto a stiff point as it often does with stiff lures. The two blades in harmony amplify the vibrations without disturbing the conformity of the frequencies emitted; increase the optical signals without making them excessive: optimize the ""target"" signal and the ""Flexible Tandem"" action demonstrates new and recognizable advantages. A jointed lure that gets perch buzzing. A combination of an Aglia blade with a Comet blade with a soft fish bait attached. Deadly for perch when fished on a slow retrieve.

The rule of thumb is use smaller lures to catch smaller fish and larger lures to catch larger fish.

Description:
There isn't a lot that can be said about the Mepps Musky Killer that hasn't already been said by musky fishermen world-wide. This is because the Mepps Musky Killer has caught more record musky than any other musky bucktail.
Sunny fall days will provide calm afternoon water, and are excellent times to fish a Musky Killer in the cabbage weeds. It’s here the muskys go to warm themselves. They also take advantage of the shadows to stalk their prey. Because of the similarity of weather conditions, this is also an excellent place to find muskys in the early summer.
Musky season opens early on many shallow northern musky lakes, and fishing these cold waters can be the key to early season action. A slow presentation is needed, and the Musky Killer's blade, like the blade on all Mepps spinners, begins spinning at even the slowest retrieve. Fish shallow bays and large flats of weeds early in the season with a Mepps Musky Killer.

Description:
The CJM 85B is a hybrid lure that combines the peculiarities and the strengths of a classic metal jig with the realism and the hydrodynamics of a hard bait. The result is a sinking lipless minnow with a very high specific weight in relation to the dimensions. This lure is characterized by an excellent castability, typical of a jig and the sinuosity typical of a stick minnow. The small size of this lure faithfully imitates the size of the forage fish, the main prey of the coastal and offshore predators. This characteristic makes the lure extremely versatile both for inshore and offshore fishing. The oscillation while the bait is sinking, combined with the pauses during the retrieval, triggers the attack of the predators. The particular groove of the snout, in the front part of the bait improves its movement both with a linear retrieval and with strong jerks. The body made of ABS is very resistant. The 3D technology and the UV coating make the colors more brilliant, durable and improves the appearance.

Fishing,Jigs / Spoon / Spinner,ChatterBait JackHammer StealthBlade  | 1/2 OZ | 1 pc/pkt,2317.0,44DD44,"ChatterBait JackHammer StealthBlade  | 1/2 OZ 

DESCRIPTIONA valuable combination of refined energy, unpredictable action and visual stealth, the new Z-Man JackHammer StealthBlade adds an exciting new chapter to the book of the bladed jig. The driving force behind the patented new ChatterBait design, a clear polycarbonate blade produces a totally different sound and vibration, but like its predecessor, starts thumping intensely with the first half-turn of the reel handle. The blade's specialized oval split-ring line tie increases stealth, and offers less surface area and no protrusions to catch vegetation or other snags. Armed with a lighter wire, custom Decoy® fluorine nanocoated hook, the StealthBlade can be cast on slightly lighter line and penetrates the jaws of bass with less hook-setting effort. To preserve the StealthBlade's high-level, ultra-durable JackHammer heritage and performance, silicone skirts are hand-tied with stainless steel wire. Dual wire trailer keepers pin soft plastic trailers in place for the long haul. The StealthBlade's low center of gravity, fish-shaped head tracks true and skips easily. When the situation suggests a bladed jig, but instinct advises finesse, the ChatterBait JackHammer StealthBlade becomes the smartest play of the day. FEATURES

Due to its natural dark green color, it is a familiar color for fish to see. SuperBraid ranges from 10-40 lb test for 4 strands and 50-80 lb test for 8 strands. Our specially coated braided line gives it a maximum abrasion resistance, and extremely low stretch, and makes it super durable giving you the best possible fishing experience.
Special Heat Integration Process makes line rounder, smoother and has significantly more abrasion resistance than other braided lines
Abrasion resistance is more than twice the traditional braided line and has drastically reduced color fading too
Rounder, tighter braid, and smoother line reduce resistance and improve casting distance
When used in jigging, water is drained better and the line can be dropped smoothly minimizing resistance caused by line slack
Long-lasting dark green color is great for muddy, stained, or mossy colored water

Description :

This is the most reliable super line during casting, strikes and fighting action as it is built with 13 fibers (12 HMPE fibers + 1 GORE Performance Fiber in core). A single strand of GORE Performance Fiber is surrounded by 12 precision braided HMPE fibers. It has been constructed in such a way that it has no weak points which leads to strength consistency.
It is said that the GORE® Performance Fiber is the most abrasion resistant textile fiber as it is solid and round like a monofilament but has the same low stretch as the PE fibers so yes there's no more problems with gliding or knots opening! In addition, the 13-carrier construction increases the number of fibers at the knot resulting in better knot tying and stronger holding power.
It has a structure in which the Sufix 131 G-Core is much rounder than any other competitor’s 12 or 16 carrier braid. The rounder line reduces the resistance in water (while retrieving) and the abrasion caused by rod guides and obstacles in the water. The line can be prevented from internal fraying with the core fiber (GORE Performance Fiber) thus making the line more durable.
A rounder line casts farther, is more silent and is more accurate. The cancelled center hole does not allow water to enter – no water means lighter line and longer casting distances.
This Sufix 131 G-Core braided line is great for casting and jigging, when you need a relatively thin line. This Sufix 131 G-Core can be recommended for example for light-tackle salt water fishing and European predator fishing.

Sparing no cost, this multi colour PE Braid is made from 8 high-end IZANAS fibres and incorporates the Shimano exclusive Heat Sink technology that disperses heat across the coating, reducing damage to the line in those long, hard fights. The VT Construction Method enables the fine braid fibres to be woven evenly at all angles, under high tension. This results in a smoother finish and reduced diameter, which aids in all aspects of casting and jigging across PE 0.8 to PE 8.0.

Description:
Though the 4-strand weave of the Daiwa J Braid x4 has a rougher profile, anglers benefit from its thinner diameter. Especially in higher line tests, the reduction in diameter can add precious yards to your reel spool. The tight weave helps to smooth out the profiles of this braid. It uses more material as there are more weaves per inch. Besides having a smoother profile, tightly woven braids reduce friction on the line guides and have a longer lifespan.
Like all quality polyethylene lines, Daiwa J Braid doesn’t stretch. You’ll feel every bite down to the smallest nibbles with this J Braid.

They also come in connected spools of six. Each spool has 100 metres of Berkley Micro Braid X4. This totals to 600 metres of lines. As of now I am not sure if one is able to purchase a single spool or will one have to purchase all six spools at once. The benefit that comes with connected spools is that one can fill large saltwater reels easily without having to connect lines to lines.

The Decoy Y-S22 is a super heavy wire, saltwater treble hook designed to tackle the strongest of trophy fish.
The hook uses 2x thick wire, that extrudes into a round bend that tapers smoothly into a hook tip that curves inward for easy hook penetration and secure holding power with its low angle barb design that suppresses resistance during penetration without compromising on holding power.
Each hook shank is welded together by strong brazing to give the Y-S22 its strength.
The hook comes with a smart eye design consisting of an indentation in the wire around the hook eye to make it easy to pass heavy rings through and suppress deterioration of their strength.
The Y-S22 is saltwater ready with highly corrosion-resistant tin plating and aqua block treatment for rust inhibition.

Fishing,Treble hooks,BKK Viper-41 Treble Hook | Size: 6-3/0,583.0,A-ET-6782," BKK Viper-41 Treble Hook 

The Viper-41 is a strong and shiny 4x treble hook designed with long and straight needle points and a very aggressive bend, developed eyeing at topwater techniques.
To reduce the overall weight of the hook and to make it stay closer to the lure we shortened the welded section of the treble, thereby also providing more flexibility to the structure.
The point is designed to maximize the hook-up rate when fishing topwater or when targeting fish that suck in the lure, while the aggressive shape of the bend ensures that the hook does not come off when the fish thrashes and jumps out of the water.
The Viper-41 is coated in Bright Tin to resist even harsh saltwater environments and comes in a wide size range  to fit a huge array of lures, from small vibes to big SW stickbaits and poppers.

A simple solution for easily rigging—and securely holding—ElaZtech® swimbaits, the ZWG™ Weighted Swimbait hook features an innovative plastic keeper moulded on the neck of the hook that pins plastics in place, even on hard casts and missed strikes. Built around heavy-duty black nickel hooks with double-tapered needle points, ZWG hooks include a silicone bead to reduce the need for Texposing and are embossed with weights for easy identification.

The double hook rig features a heavy-duty solid ring tied to the wide gap Mustad hook with high quality PE and Kevlar materials. The two assist hooks are connected to the top end of the slim jigging lure to improve hookset, as the fish often strikes at the top end. Another benefit is less snags because of the absence of the traditional tail treble. The assist hook has two luminous beads to attract attention, creating a striking point. The slow pitch fishing technique has proven great on slow days when fish are not as active and less of a strain on the arms as speed jigging. These hooks were tested over a period of 2 years by Mustad's pro staff before they were launched.

Worm slip on the back of the lid prevents the worm from snagging

It also fits in your sponge pocket.
Made in Japan 🔴

This joint series is ideal for storing jigs and worms used in lure games. The inside of the lid has a worm slip treatment that makes it difficult for worms to stick, making it ideal for storing worms used in horse mackerel fishing. It is also just the right size for lightweight jigs used in SLJ and tungsten jigs of around 50g. It is easy to take out tai rubber tackles, skirts and ties without getting tangled, so it is useful both onshore and offshore.

Two systems can be stored on the middle tray of the BM-5000 and VS-7080/7080N, and on the top shelf of the VS-7070/7070N and VS-7055/7055N.

The versatility of these pliers means that you are almost certain to use them on every fishing trip.
The Surecatch Gripmaster Pliers (Bent Nose) are specifically designed for de-hooking fish.
They feature an extra-long nose that makes light work of getting into those hard-to-reach areas, such as when a fish has been hooked deep, and the angled, bent nose makes it easy to pry the hook free.
If you want to release a fish, it is paramount that you de-hook it quickly so it can be revived in the water as soon as possible to ensure its chances of survival.
They can also be used for crimping, closing split-shot sinkers and cutting lines.

Mustad Tackle Protection range of products are constructed using a high-density Neoprene foam material which has a low compression set. Compression set is the measure of a material's ability to return to its original thickness after prolonged compressive stresses. A lower compression set is generally more ideal, indicating that material would resist deformation better, hence cushioning your fishing tackle against knocks and scratches.
Neoprene is an inert material which does not react with chemicals such as oil and grease commonly used on fishing reels or any sprays used on rod guides against corrosion resistance. neoprene is also resistant to weathering, especially from UV rays which may cause flex cracking, making it an ideal material for protecting your tackle in outdoor situations.

It is a connection item that has both characteristics of a ring on one side and a snap on the other side. While making the connection part compact, it can be used in a variety of ways that have never existed before. For example, if you attach it to a jigging assist hook, you can change the hook without pliers. Also, if you connect a sinker to the ring side, it becomes a weight that can be attached with one touch, which is effective for deep egging and octopus fishing. The bend of the lock part is gentle, so it is easy to attach to the recessed eye such as poppers.

Change the common sense of snaps that can be smoothly and quickly attached and detached without the troublesome work of opening and closing the snaps when exchanging lures? ! It is a simple snap that does not need to be opened and closed. The vent part is also a round vent shape, which does not impair the lure action and supports any action. Soldering process is applied to the eye seam part to eliminate concerns about strength, and it is especially suitable for area fishing and rockfishing, which are mainly in the cold season. I recommend it because there is no opening and closing work with numb hands.

Just turn through the eye! Design that does not require opening and closing.
Round vent shape that draws out lure action.
SOLDERING processing (welding) is used to eliminate concerns about the strength of the eye seam.
It supports various lures from micro lures to seabass lures regardless of fresh salt water.

Fishing,Swivels / Snaps,Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip,285.0,40116977434742,"Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip
Clips have a pretty mixed reputation. Many anglers absolutely swear by them. Others are more cautious, preferring a more pragmatic approach to lure and rig connections. Most anglers will have a story of how a clip has inexplicably uncoupled from the rig or lure, resulting in the loss of the best fish ever. Mustad continually refines terminal tackle design with the sole purpose of ensuring you catch more fish. The Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip is the latest innovation in fishing clips and is proving to be a revelation. The first feature is the ease at which lures and rigs can be changed. It’s a very fast process. The speed of a lure change is often critical, particularly when you are going through your lure arsenal, trying to see which lure the fish you are casting at will respond to. Without a method for a quick change, the fish will often move on before you have tied the knot on your second lure. The Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip is the ultimate connection. There is no way the lure can become disconnected. Even if the clip is taking mouth pressure from the fish, there is no ‘latching’ system that can come undone via pressure. The Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip for sale now is available. If your budget can afford it we suggest Grabbing a couple of test weights, test the veracity of the lofty claims, and never lose a fish to clip failure or slow lure change again.

Fishing,Rigging Accessories,SureCatch Bait Needle | Size: 18cm | 5Pcs,121.0,39658985160822,"Despite the proliferation of lures for every circumstance, particularly trolling for mega fish, the live baitfish or dead fish baits are still as popular as ever for all our favorite pelagics. While rigging or ‘baiting-up’ for this style of fishing is highly demanding, the process is made quicker and easier if you use quality tools.
The Surecatch live bait needle is ideally suited for tying bridle rigs. The bridle rig is preferred offshore for a number of reasons. Firstly, trolling a baitfish for maximum performance requires rigging the fish to swim forwards as naturally as possible; The bridle rig delivers.
Secondly, the bridle rig is well suited for running ’J’ and circle hooks, with the latter becoming the hook of choice for so many offshore flesh bait applications and game fishing tournaments.
A strong and reliable rig can be the difference between tagging your target and not getting a touch. Using the right tools, and attention to detail, can make the difference between achieving a reliable rig and a second-rate bait-up.
While tying a reliable rig and achieving peak action from our bait are the goals, we also want to be able to complete our rigs quickly. A bait that’s not in the water will never catch a fish.
Surecatch Bait needles come in a packet of 5. They’re 1mm thick and 130mm long. The eyes are easy to thread without being so big as to compromise the rig by putting big holes in your bait. The live bait needle is an essential kit for the pro angler and blue water regular. Grab a pack so you’re never without a sharp one.

Fishing,Rigging Accessories,Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip,285.0,40116977434742,"Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip
Clips have a pretty mixed reputation. Many anglers absolutely swear by them. Others are more cautious, preferring a more pragmatic approach to lure and rig connections. Most anglers will have a story of how a clip has inexplicably uncoupled from the rig or lure, resulting in the loss of the best fish ever. Mustad continually refines terminal tackle design with the sole purpose of ensuring you catch more fish. The Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip is the latest innovation in fishing clips and is proving to be a revelation. The first feature is the ease at which lures and rigs can be changed. It’s a very fast process. The speed of a lure change is often critical, particularly when you are going through your lure arsenal, trying to see which lure the fish you are casting at will respond to. Without a method for a quick change, the fish will often move on before you have tied the knot on your second lure. The Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip is the ultimate connection. There is no way the lure can become disconnected. Even if the clip is taking mouth pressure from the fish, there is no ‘latching’ system that can come undone via pressure. The Mustad Ultrapoint Fastach Clip for sale now is available. If your budget can afford it we suggest Grabbing a couple of test weights, test the veracity of the lofty claims, and never lose a fish to clip failure or slow lure change again.

MUSTAD FTFW Fastach Football Weight
The unique Mustad Fastach American football weight jigging system makes changing the hook/lure quicker and easier out on the water. Simply twist off your hook/lure, replace it with something smaller, bigger or different color, and you are good to go. The hook hangs loosely from the clip giving a more lively presentation than from fixed head jigs. The tying eye is set at 60 degrees, which reduces possible snags and lets the bait sink vertically.
The Mustad Fastach Football Weights are designed with a convenient fastach connection which provides anglers with a more efficient way to explore rocky terrain. The Fastach connector on these weights are molded directly into the head which allows anglers to slide hooks on and off with a twist of the wrist, so there is no need to re-tie when anglers want to change baits or hook size.

Self-cocking Crossbow Pistol Cross 80 Lbs
This 80 lb draw weight crossbow uses an easy and safe-to-use cocking mechanism. Manufactured with a strong plastic body and compressed molded fiberglass bow, this crossbow pistol is very durable and perfect for target practice. With a firing speed of 165 fps, the 80 lb crossbow is great for small games. The new self-cocking mechanism is much more safe and far less strenuous to use. By simply pulling down on a pivoting arm lever, this crossbow's cable is cocked much more easily, even engaging the safety automatically. The speediness of the new cocking mechanism shortens reload time, allowing you to get off more shots quickly. Like all weapons and gear, proper maintenance is essential in prolonging the life of your crossbow. With each use, elements of the crossbow can begin to wear. We also recommend applying rail lube often to your crossbow's rail slide and wax to your string to decrease the friction that can hurt your string. It's also recommended to check the tightness of your crossbow's screws often as vibration can loosen them over time.

Aluminum Damper

The grill features an aluminum intake damper that provides rust resistance and an easy intake of oxygen to keep your barbecue alive and burning. The damper sits on a dome-shaped lid that circulates the air perfectly for smoking.

















Ash Catcher

A removable ash catcher made of galvanized steel sits right below the charcoal bowl and catches any ash that falls out, avoiding any sort of a mess on your floor and makes for an easy clean-up.

















Cooking Grate

The removable steel plated cooking grate provides a durable and sturdy cooking area of 1520 sq cm, that is not only large enough for all your barbecue needs, but also quite easy to clean.



















Bowl and Charcoal Grate

The bowl itself is protected with a porcelain-enamel coating, making it heat resistant and waterproof, allowing you to clean the bowl post use with minimum effort. A second steel plated grate at the bottom of the bowl provides an elevated platform to place your charcoal on. Not only does this help in keeping your charcoal separate from ash, but also allows for even burning due to the additional circulation it provides.

















Handle and Wheels

Mild steel handles on either side of the bowl, combined with all-weather wheels attached to stainless steel legs, make the Roundhouse Tripod easy to move around and able to withstand all outdoor conditions.

















From the Manufacturer

Our grills are made of quality materials and incorporate a bunch of features keeping in mind the requirements of your inner chef.
